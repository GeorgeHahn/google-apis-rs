Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/iam1-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/iam1-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \niam\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue.

For example, a structure like this:  CreateRoleRequest:\n  role:\n    deleted: boolean\n    description: string\n    etag: string\n    included-permissions: [string]\n    name: string\n    stage: string\n    title: string\n  role-id: string  can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.   -r .role    deleted=false  The current deleted state of the role. This field is read only.\n    It will be ignored in calls to CreateRole and UpdateRole.    description=erat  Optional.  A human-readable description for the role.    etag=sadipscing  Used to perform a consistent read-modify-write.    included-permissions=dolor  The names of the permissions this role grants when bound in an IAM policy.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.     name=eirmod    The name of the role.  When Role is used in CreateRole, the role name must not be set.  When Role is used in output and other input such as UpdateRole, the role\nname is the complete path, e.g., roles/logging.viewer for curated roles\nand organizations/{ORGANIZATION_ID}/roles/logging.viewer for custom roles.\n*  stage=elitr \n    - The current launch stage of the role. If the  ALPHA  launch stage has been\nselected for a role, the  stage  field will not be included in the\nreturned definition for the role.\n*  title=amet \n    - Optional.

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. .

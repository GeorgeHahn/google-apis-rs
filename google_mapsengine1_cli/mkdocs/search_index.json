Defaults to\n            a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation.\n            [default: ~/.google-service-cli]\n  --debug\n            Output all server communication to standard error. `tx` and `rx` are placed\n            into the same stream.\n  --debug-auth\n            Output all communication related to authentication to standard error. `tx`\n            and `rx` are placed into the same stream.\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nThe program will store all persistent data in the \n~/.google-service-cli\n directory in \nJSON\n files prefixed with \nmapsengine1-\n.  You can change the directory used to store configuration with the \n--config-dir\n flag on a per-invocation basis.\n\n\nMore information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMost APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the \nscope\n determines the \nset of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/mapsengine1-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/mapsengine1-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \nmapsengine\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \nmapsengine1 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .    attribution=sanctus\n\n\nThe name of the attribution to be used for this RasterCollection. Note: Attribution is returned in response to a get request but not a list request. After requesting a list of raster collections, you\nll need to send a get request to retrieve the attribution for each raster collection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbbox=0.429944554623\n\n\nA rectangular bounding box which contains all of the data in this RasterCollection.

If you created a GME account/project after July 14th, 2014, you will not be able to send API requests that include access lists. Note: This is an input field only.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly.

The user on whose behalf the request is being sent must be an editor on that access list. Note: Google Maps Engine no longer uses access lists. Instead, each asset has its own list of permissions. For backward compatibility, the API still accepts access lists for projects that are already using access lists. If you created a GME account/project after July 14th, 2014, you will not be able to send API requests that include access lists. Note: This is an input field only. It is not returned in response to a list or get request.    etag=sadipscing  The ETag, used to refer to the current version of the asset.    id=rebum.  A globally unique ID, used to refer to this RasterCollection.    last-modified-time=dolore  The last modified time of this RasterCollection.

The user on whose behalf the request is being sent must be an editor on that access list. Note: Google Maps Engine no longer uses access lists. Instead, each asset has its own list of permissions. For backward compatibility, the API still accepts access lists for projects that are already using access lists. If you created a GME account/project after July 14th, 2014, you will not be able to send API requests that include access lists. Note: This is an input field only. It is not returned in response to a list or get request.    etag=diam  The ETag, used to refer to the current version of the asset.    id=ut  A globally unique ID, used to refer to this Raster.    last-modified-time=justo  The last modified time of this raster. The value is an RFC 3339 formatted date-time value (e.g. 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z).    last-modifier-email=est  The email address of the last modifier of this raster. This is only returned on GET requests and not LIST requests.    mask-type=amet  The mask processing type of this Raster.    name=accusam  The name of this Raster, supplied by the author.    processing-status=clita  The processing status of this Raster.    project-id=diam  The ID of the project that this Raster is in.    raster-type=justo  The type of this Raster. Always  image  today.    writers-can-edit-permissions=false  If true, WRITERs of the asset are able to edit the asset permissions.     About Cursors  The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:   The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the  .  character. Fields can be nested such as in  -r f.s.o  .  The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. .

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. .

If you created a GME account/project after July 14th, 2014, you will not be able to send API requests that include access lists. Note: This is an input field only. It is not returned in response to a list or get request.    etag=labore  The ETag, used to refer to the current version of the asset.    id=aliquyam  A globally unique ID, used to refer to this table.    last-modified-time=elitr  The last modified time of this table. The value is an RFC 3339 formatted date-time value (e.g. 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z).    last-modifier-email=consetetur  The email address of the last modifier of this table. This is only returned on GET requests and not LIST requests.    name=sea  The name of this table, supplied by the author.    processing-status=elitr  The processing status of this table.    project-id=at  The ID of the project to which the table belongs.    published-access-list=sea  Deprecated: The access list to whom view permissions are granted. The value must be the name of a Maps Engine access list of the Map Viewer type, and the user must be a viewer on that list. Note: Google Maps Engine no longer uses access lists.

It is not returned in response to a list or get request.    schema    primary-geometry=consetetur  The name of the column that contains a feature s geometry. This field can be omitted during table create; Google Maps Engine supports only a single geometry column, which must be named geometry and be the first object in the columns array.     primary-key=diam   The name of the column that contains the unique identifier of a Feature.     ..    source-encoding=accusam   Encoding of the uploaded files. Valid values include UTF-8, CP1251, ISO 8859-1, and Shift_JIS.    writers-can-edit-permissions=false  If true, WRITERs of the asset are able to edit the asset permissions.     About Cursors  The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:   The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the  .  character. Fields can be nested such as in  -r f.s.o  .  The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. . Each additional  .  moves it up one additional level. E.g.  ...  would go three levels up.",

Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero.\n\n\nIf data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools.\n\n\nEverything else about the \ncompute\n API can be found at the\n\nofficial documentation site\n.\n\n\nDownloads\n\n\nYou can download the pre-compiled 64bit binaries for the following platforms:\n\n\n\n\n \nubuntu\n\n\n \nosx\n\n\n\n\nFind the source code \non github\n.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nThis documentation was generated from the \ncompute\n API at revision \n20160328\n.

Defaults to\n            a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation.\n            [default: ~/.google-service-cli]\n  --debug\n            Output all server communication to standard error. `tx` and `rx` are placed\n            into the same stream.\n  --debug-auth\n            Output all communication related to authentication to standard error. `tx`\n            and `rx` are placed into the same stream.\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nThe program will store all persistent data in the \n~/.google-service-cli\n directory in \nJSON\n files prefixed with \ncompute1-\n.  You can change the directory used to store configuration with the \n--config-dir\n flag on a per-invocation basis.\n\n\nMore information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMost APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the \nscope\n determines the \nset of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/compute1-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/compute1-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \ncompute\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \ncompute1 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.\n\n\nThe field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.\n\n\nFor example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.\n\n\nCompute Engine Beta API Only: If you use filtering in the Beta API, you can also filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. In particular, use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of instance labels to organize and filter results based on label values.\n\n\nThe Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses.

About Cursors  The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:   The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the  .  character. Fields can be nested such as in  -r f.s.o  .  The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. . Each additional  .  moves it up one additional level. E.g.  ...  would go three levels up.",

Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression \na-z\n? which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\noptions=aliquyam\n\n\nInternal use only.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nself-link=eos\n\n\n[Output Only] Server-defined fully-qualified URL for this resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsize-gb=tempor\n\n\n\n\nSize of the persistent disk, specified in GB. You can specify this field when creating a persistent disk using the sourceImage or sourceSnapshot parameter, or specify it alone to create an empty persistent disk.\n\n\nIf you specify this field along with sourceImage or sourceSnapshot, the value of sizeGb must not be less than the size of the sourceImage or the size of the snapshot.\n* \nsource-image=sea\n\n    - The source image used to create this disk. If the source image is deleted, this field will not be set.\n\n\nTo create a disk with one of the public operating system images, specify the image by its family name. For example, specify family/debian-8 to use the latest Debian 8 image:\n\n\nprojects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-8 \n\n\nAlternatively, use a specific version of a public operating system image:\n\n\nprojects/debian-cloud/global/images/debian-8-jessie-vYYYYMMDD \n\n\nTo create a disk with a private image that you created, specify the image name in the following format:\n\n\nglobal/images/my-private-image \n\n\nYou can also specify a private image by its image family, which returns the latest version of the image in that family. Replace the image name with family/family-name:\n\n\nglobal/images/family/my-private-family\n\n \nsource-image-id=labore\n\n    - [Output Only] The ID value of the image used to create this disk. This value identifies the exact image that was used to create this persistent disk. For example, if you created the persistent disk from an image that was later deleted and recreated under the same name, the source image ID would identify the exact version of the image that was used.\n\n \nsource-snapshot=ipsum\n\n    - The source snapshot used to create this disk. You can provide this as a partial or full URL to the resource. For example, the following are valid values:\n\n- https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/global/snapshots/snapshot \n- projects/project/global/snapshots/snapshot \n- global/snapshots/snapshot\n\n \nsource-snapshot-id=aliquyam\n\n    - [Output Only] The unique ID of the snapshot used to create this disk. This value identifies the exact snapshot that was used to create this persistent disk. For example, if you created the persistent disk from a snapshot that was later deleted and recreated under the same name, the source snapshot ID would identify the exact version of the snapshot that was used.\n\n \nstatus=dolores\n\n    - [Output Only] The status of disk creation. Applicable statuses includes: CREATING, FAILED, READY, RESTORING.\n\n \ntype=sit\n\n    - URL of the disk type resource describing which disk type to use to create the disk. Provide this when creating the disk.\n\n \nusers=diam\n\n    - [Output Only] Links to the users of the disk (attached instances) in form: project/zones/zone/instances/instance\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n* \nzone=ut\n\n    - [Output Only] URL of the zone where the disk resides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.

Provide this property when you create the resource.    id=accusam  [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.    kind=clita  [Output Ony] Type of the resource. Always compute#firewall for firewall rules.    name=diam  Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression  a-z ? which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.    network=justo  URL of the network resource for this firewall rule. If not specified when creating a firewall rule, the default network is used:\n    global/networks/default\n    If you choose to specify this property, you can specify the network as a full or partial URL. For example, the following are all valid URLs:    https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/global/networks/my-network   projects/myproject/global/networks/my-network   global/networks/default      self-link=est  [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.    source-ranges=clita   The IP address blocks that this rule applies to, expressed in CIDR format. One or both of sourceRanges and sourceTags may be set.  If both properties are set, an inbound connection is allowed if the range matches the sourceRanges OR the tag of the source matches the sourceTags property.

If no targetTags are specified, the firewall rule applies to all instances on the specified network.\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.      About Cursors  The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:   The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the  .  character. Fields can be nested such as in  -r f.s.o  .  The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. . Each additional  .  moves it up one additional level. E.g.  ...  would go three levels up.",

In particular, use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of instance labels to organize and filter results based on label values.\n\n\nThe Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f).

The suggested replacement resource must be the same kind of resource as the deprecated resource.     state=magna   The deprecation state of this resource. This can be DEPRECATED, OBSOLETE, or DELETED. Operations which create a new resource using a DEPRECATED resource will return successfully, but with a warning indicating the deprecated resource and recommending its replacement. Operations which use OBSOLETE or DELETED resources will be rejected and result in an error.     ..    description=gubergren   An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.    disk-size-gb=sit  Size of the image when restored onto a persistent disk (in GB).    id=gubergren  [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.    kind=sit  [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#image for images.    licenses=amet  Any applicable publicly visible licenses.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    name=eirmod  Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression  a-z ? which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.    raw-disk    container-type=sanctus  The format used to encode and transmit the block device, which should be TAR. This is just a container and transmission format and not a runtime format. Provided by the client when the disk image is created.    sha1-checksum=lorem  An optional SHA1 checksum of the disk image before unpackaging; provided by the client when the disk image is created.     source=amet.   The full Google Cloud Storage URL where the disk image is stored. You must provide either this property or the sourceDisk property but not both.     ..    self-link=diam   [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.    source-disk=eirmod  URL of the The source disk used to create this image. This can be a full or valid partial URL. You must provide either this property or the rawDisk.source property but not both to create an image. For example, the following are valid values:    https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/zones/zone/disk/disk   projects/project/zones/zone/disk/disk   zones/zone/disks/disk      source-disk-id=sadipscing  The ID value of the disk used to create this image. This value may be used to determine whether the image was taken from the current or a previous instance of a given disk name.    source-type=lorem  The type of the image used to create this disk. The default and only value is RAW    status=sed  [Output Only] The status of the image. An image can be used to create other resources, such as instances, only after the image has been successfully created and the status is set to READY. Possible values are FAILED, PENDING, or READY.     About Cursors  The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:   The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the  .  character. Fields can be nested such as in  -r f.s.o  .  The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. . Each additional  .  moves it up one additional level. E.g.  ...  would go three levels up.",

Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.\n\n\nThe field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.\n\n\nFor example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.\n\n\nCompute Engine Beta API Only: If you use filtering in the Beta API, you can also filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. In particular, use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of instance labels to organize and filter results based on label values.\n\n\nThe Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p max-results=integer\n\n\n\n\nThe maximum number of results per page that should be returned.

Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.     -p filter=string    Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.  The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.  For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.  Compute Engine Beta API Only: If you use filtering in the Beta API, you can also filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. In particular, use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of instance labels to organize and filter results based on label values.  The Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.      -p max-results=integer   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .    creation-timestamp=erat\n\n\n[Output Only] The creation timestamp for this instance group in RFC3339 text format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndescription=et\n\n\nAn optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfingerprint=amet\n\n\n[Output Only] The fingerprint of the named ports. The system uses this fingerprint to detect conflicts when multiple users change the named ports concurrently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid=lorem\n\n\n[Output Only] A unique identifier for this resource type. The server generates this identifier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkind=voluptua.\n\n\n[Output Only] The resource type, which is always compute#instanceGroup for instance groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname=rebum.\n\n\nThe name of the instance group. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnetwork=justo\n\n\nThe URL of the network to which all instances in the instance group belong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nself-link=labore\n\n\n[Output Only] The URL for this instance group.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly.

Please note that  -p  is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this  -p k1=v1 k2=v2  even though the listing below repeats the -p  for completeness.    -p filter=string    Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.  The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.  For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.  Compute Engine Beta API Only: If you use filtering in the Beta API, you can also filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. In particular, use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of instance labels to organize and filter results based on label values.  The Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.      -p page-token=string   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.     -p max-results=integer   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.",

Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.\n\n\nFor example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.\n\n\nCompute Engine Beta API Only: If you use filtering in the Beta API, you can also filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. In particular, use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of instance labels to organize and filter results based on label values.\n\n\nThe Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p page-token=string\n\n\n\n\nSpecifies a page token to use.

For example, the following are valid values:\n\n- https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/zones/zone/diskTypes/diskType \n- projects/project/zones/zone/diskTypes/diskType \n- zones/zone/diskTypes/diskType\n* \nsource-image=kasd\n\n    - The source image used to create this disk.\n\n\nTo create a disk with a private image, specify the image name in the following format:\n\n\nglobal/images/my-private-image \n\n\nTo create a disk with a public image, specify the image name and the project that owns the image. For example, you can use a Debian image from the debian-cloud project:\n\n\nprojects/debian-cloud/global/images/debian-8-jessie-vYYYYMMDD \n\n\nThe vYYYYMMDD value is the image version. The fully-qualified URL also works in both examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    interface=ut\n\n\n\n\nSpecifies the disk interface to use for attaching this disk, which is either SCSI or NVME. The default is SCSI. Persistent disks must always use SCSI and the request will fail if you attempt to attach a persistent disk in any other format than SCSI. Local SSDs can use either NVME or SCSI.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.  For example, a structure like this:  AttachedDisk:\n  auto-delete: boolean\n  boot: boolean\n  device-name: string\n  index: integer\n  initialize-params:\n    disk-name: string\n    disk-size-gb: string\n    disk-type: string\n    source-image: string\n  interface: string\n  kind: string\n  licenses: [string]\n  mode: string\n  source: string\n  type: string  can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.   -r .    auto-delete=true  Specifies whether the disk will be auto-deleted when the instance is deleted (but not when the disk is detached from the instance).    boot=true  Indicates that this is a boot disk. The virtual machine will use the first partition of the disk for its root filesystem.     device-name=sit    Specifies a unique device name of your choice that is reflected into the /dev/disk/by-id/google-* tree of a Linux operating system running within the instance. This name can be used to reference the device for mounting, resizing, and so on, from within the instance.  If not specified, the server chooses a default device name to apply to this disk, in the form persistent-disks-x, where x is a number assigned by Google Compute Engine. This field is only applicable for persistent disks.   index=32 \n    - Assigns a zero-based index to this disk, where 0 is reserved for the boot disk. For example, if you have many disks attached to an instance, each disk would have a unique index number. If not specified, the server will choose an appropriate value.   initialize-params    disk-name=et \n    - Specifies the disk name. If not specified, the default is to use the name of the instance.   disk-size-gb=sanctus \n    - Specifies the size of the disk in base-2 GB.   disk-type=takimata \n    - Specifies the disk type to use to create the instance. If not specified, the default is pd-standard, specified using the full URL. For example:  https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/zones/zone/diskTypes/pd-standard   Other values include pd-ssd and local-ssd. If you define this field, you can provide either the full or partial URL. For example, the following are valid values: \n- https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/zones/zone/diskTypes/diskType \n- projects/project/zones/zone/diskTypes/diskType \n- zones/zone/diskTypes/diskType\n*  source-image=kasd \n    - The source image used to create this disk.  To create a disk with a private image, specify the image name in the following format:  global/images/my-private-image   To create a disk with a public image, specify the image name and the project that owns the image. For example, you can use a Debian image from the debian-cloud project:  projects/debian-cloud/global/images/debian-8-jessie-vYYYYMMDD   The vYYYYMMDD value is the image version. The fully-qualified URL also works in both examples.      ..    interface=ut   Specifies the disk interface to use for attaching this disk, which is either SCSI or NVME. The default is SCSI. Persistent disks must always use SCSI and the request will fail if you attempt to attach a persistent disk in any other format than SCSI. Local SSDs can use either NVME or SCSI. For performance characteristics of SCSI over NVMe, see Local SSD performance.    kind=sadipscing  [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#attachedDisk for attached disks.    licenses=et  [Output Only] Any valid publicly visible licenses.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    mode=clita  The mode in which to attach this disk, either READ_WRITE or READ_ONLY. If not specified, the default is to attach the disk in READ_WRITE mode.    source=ipsum  Specifies a valid partial or full URL to an existing Persistent Disk resource. This field is only applicable for persistent disks.    type=dolor  Specifies the type of the disk, either SCRATCH or PERSISTENT. If not specified, the default is PERSISTENT.     About Cursors  The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:   The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the  .  character. Fields can be nested such as in  -r f.s.o  .  The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. .

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .    can-ip-forward=false\n\n\nAllows this instance to send and receive packets with non-matching destination or source IPs. This is required if you plan to use this instance to forward routes.

This is provided by the client when the instance is created. For example, the following is a valid partial url to a predefined machine type:\n\n\nzones/us-central1-f/machineTypes/n1-standard-1 \n\n\nTo create a custom machine type, provide a URL to a machine type in the following format, where CPUS is 1 or an even number up to 32 (2, 4, 6, ... 24, etc), and MEMORY is the total memory for this instance. Memory must be a multiple of 256 MB and must be supplied in MB (e.g. 5 GB of memory is 5120 MB):\n\n\nzones/zone/machineTypes/custom-CPUS-MEMORY \n\n\nFor example: zones/us-central1-f/machineTypes/custom-4-5120 \n\n\nFor a full list of restrictions, read the Specifications for custom machine types.\n\n \nmetadata    fingerprint=eirmod\n\n    - Specifies a fingerprint for this request, which is essentially a hash of the metadata\ns contents and used for optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update metadata. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change metadata.\n\n \nkind=no\n\n    - [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#metadata for metadata.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    name=lorem\n\n\n\n\nThe name of the resource, provided by the client when initially creating the resource. The resource name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression \na-z\n? which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscheduling    automatic-restart=true\n\n\nSpecifies whether the instance should be automatically restarted if it is terminated by Compute Engine (not terminated by a user). You can only set the automatic restart option for standard instances. Preemptible instances cannot be automatically restarted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\non-host-maintenance=tempor\n\n\nDefines the maintenance behavior for this instance. For standard instances, the default behavior is MIGRATE. For preemptible instances, the default and only possible behavior is TERMINATE. For more information, see Setting Instance Scheduling Options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npreemptible=false\n\n\n\n\nWhether the instance is preemptible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    self-link=kasd\n\n\n\n\n[Output Only] Server-defined URL for this resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstatus=elitr\n\n\n[Output Only] The status of the instance. One of the following values: PROVISIONING, STAGING, RUNNING, STOPPING, and TERMINATED.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstatus-message=et\n\n\n[Output Only] An optional, human-readable explanation of the status.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntags    fingerprint=vero\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifies a fingerprint for this request, which is essentially a hash of the metadata\ns contents and used for optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update metadata. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change metadata.\n\n\nTo see the latest fingerprint, make get() request to the instance.\n* \nitems=sadipscing\n\n    - An array of tags. Each tag must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    zone=sed\n\n\n\n\n[Output Only] URL of the zone where the instance resides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.   -r .    can-ip-forward=false  Allows this instance to send and receive packets with non-matching destination or source IPs. This is required if you plan to use this instance to forward routes. For more information, see Enabling IP Forwarding.    cpu-platform=magna  [Output Only] The CPU platform used by this instance.    creation-timestamp=aliquyam  [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.    description=kasd  An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.    id=duo  [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.    kind=et  [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#instance for instances.     machine-type=sit    Full or partial URL of the machine type resource to use for this instance, in the format: zones/zone/machineTypes/machine-type. This is provided by the client when the instance is created. For example, the following is a valid partial url to a predefined machine type:  zones/us-central1-f/machineTypes/n1-standard-1   To create a custom machine type, provide a URL to a machine type in the following format, where CPUS is 1 or an even number up to 32 (2, 4, 6, ... 24, etc), and MEMORY is the total memory for this instance. Memory must be a multiple of 256 MB and must be supplied in MB (e.g. 5 GB of memory is 5120 MB):  zones/zone/machineTypes/custom-CPUS-MEMORY   For example: zones/us-central1-f/machineTypes/custom-4-5120   For a full list of restrictions, read the Specifications for custom machine types.   metadata    fingerprint=eirmod \n    - Specifies a fingerprint for this request, which is essentially a hash of the metadata s contents and used for optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update metadata. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change metadata.   kind=no \n    - [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#metadata for metadata.      ..    name=lorem   The name of the resource, provided by the client when initially creating the resource. The resource name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression  a-z ? which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.    scheduling    automatic-restart=true  Specifies whether the instance should be automatically restarted if it is terminated by Compute Engine (not terminated by a user). You can only set the automatic restart option for standard instances. Preemptible instances cannot be automatically restarted.    on-host-maintenance=tempor  Defines the maintenance behavior for this instance. For standard instances, the default behavior is MIGRATE. For preemptible instances, the default and only possible behavior is TERMINATE. For more information, see Setting Instance Scheduling Options.     preemptible=false   Whether the instance is preemptible.     ..    self-link=kasd   [Output Only] Server-defined URL for this resource.    status=elitr  [Output Only] The status of the instance. One of the following values: PROVISIONING, STAGING, RUNNING, STOPPING, and TERMINATED.    status-message=et  [Output Only] An optional, human-readable explanation of the status.     tags    fingerprint=vero    Specifies a fingerprint for this request, which is essentially a hash of the metadata s contents and used for optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update metadata. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change metadata.  To see the latest fingerprint, make get() request to the instance.\n*  items=sadipscing \n    - An array of tags. Each tag must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.      ..    zone=sed   [Output Only] URL of the zone where the instance resides.     About Cursors  The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:   The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the  .  character. Fields can be nested such as in  -r f.s.o  .  The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. . Each additional  .  moves it up one additional level. E.g.  ...  would go three levels up.",

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. . Each additional  .  moves it up one additional level. E.g.  ...  would go three levels up.",

Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.\n\n\nThe field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.\n\n\nFor example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.\n\n\nCompute Engine Beta API Only: If you use filtering in the Beta API, you can also filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. In particular, use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of instance labels to organize and filter results based on label values.\n\n\nThe Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p max-results=integer\n\n\n\n\nThe maximum number of results per page that should be returned.

Please note that  -p  is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this  -p k1=v1 k2=v2  even though the listing below repeats the -p  for completeness.    -p filter=string    Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.  The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.  For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.  Compute Engine Beta API Only: If you use filtering in the Beta API, you can also filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. In particular, use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of instance labels to organize and filter results based on label values.  The Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.      -p max-results=integer   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.

Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.     -p filter=string    Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.  The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.  For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.  Compute Engine Beta API Only: If you use filtering in the Beta API, you can also filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. In particular, use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of instance labels to organize and filter results based on label values.  The Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.      -p max-results=integer   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.

Please note that  -p  is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this  -p k1=v1 k2=v2  even though the listing below repeats the -p  for completeness.    -p filter=string    Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.  The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.  For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.  Compute Engine Beta API Only: If you use filtering in the Beta API, you can also filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. In particular, use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of instance labels to organize and filter results based on label values.  The Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.      -p page-token=string   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.     -p max-results=integer   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.",

Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.\n\n\nThe field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.\n\n\nFor example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.\n\n\nCompute Engine Beta API Only: If you use filtering in the Beta API, you can also filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. In particular, use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of instance labels to organize and filter results based on label values.\n\n\nThe Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p page-token=string\n\n\n\n\nSpecifies a page token to use.

If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.     -p filter=string    Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.  The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.  For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.  Compute Engine Beta API Only: If you use filtering in the Beta API, you can also filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. In particular, use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of instance labels to organize and filter results based on label values.  The Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.      -p page-token=string   Specifies a page token to use.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.   -r .    backup-pool=amet   This field is applicable only when the containing target pool is serving a forwarding rule as the primary pool, and its failoverRatio field is properly set to a value between [0, 1].  backupPool and failoverRatio together define the fallback behavior of the primary target pool: if the ratio of the healthy instances in the primary pool is at or below failoverRatio, traffic arriving at the load-balanced IP will be directed to the backup pool.  In case where failoverRatio and backupPool are not set, or all the instances in the backup pool are unhealthy, the traffic will be directed back to the primary pool in the  force  mode, where traffic will be spread to the healthy instances with the best effort, or to all instances when no instance is healthy.   creation-timestamp=dolor \n    - [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.   description=voluptua. \n    - An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.\n*  failover-ratio=0.276060188543 \n    - This field is applicable only when the containing target pool is serving a forwarding rule as the primary pool (i.e., not as a backup pool to some other target pool). The value of the field must be in [0, 1].  If set, backupPool must also be set. They together define the fallback behavior of the primary target pool: if the ratio of the healthy instances in the primary pool is at or below this number, traffic arriving at the load-balanced IP will be directed to the backup pool.  In case where failoverRatio is not set or all the instances in the backup pool are unhealthy, the traffic will be directed back to the primary pool in the  force  mode, where traffic will be spread to the healthy instances with the best effort, or to all instances when no instance is healthy.   health-checks=elitr \n    - A list of URLs to the HttpHealthCheck resource. A member instance in this pool is considered healthy if and only if all specified health checks pass. An empty list means all member instances will be considered healthy at all times.\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.   id=kasd \n    - [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.   instances=sit \n    - A list of resource URLs to the virtual machine instances serving this pool. They must live in zones contained in the same region as this pool.\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.   kind=justo \n    - [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#targetPool for target pools.   name=gubergren \n    - Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression  a-z ? which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.   region=ipsum \n    - [Output Only] URL of the region where the target pool resides.   self-link=amet. \n    - [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.   session-affinity=dolor \n    - Sesssion affinity option, must be one of the following values:\nNONE: Connections from the same client IP may go to any instance in the pool.\nCLIENT_IP: Connections from the same client IP will go to the same instance in the pool while that instance remains healthy.\nCLIENT_IP_PROTO: Connections from the same client IP with the same IP protocol will go to the same instance in the pool while that instance remains healthy.      About Cursors  The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures.

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. .

Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.\n\n\nFor example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.\n\n\nCompute Engine Beta API Only: If you use filtering in the Beta API, you can also filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. In particular, use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of instance labels to organize and filter results based on label values.\n\n\nThe Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p page-token=string\n\n\n\n\nSpecifies a page token to use.

The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax.

For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. In particular, use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of instance labels to organize and filter results based on label values.\n\n\nThe Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses.

Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.  For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.  Compute Engine Beta API Only: If you use filtering in the Beta API, you can also filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. In particular, use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of instance labels to organize and filter results based on label values.  The Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.      -p page-token=string   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.     -p max-results=integer   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.",

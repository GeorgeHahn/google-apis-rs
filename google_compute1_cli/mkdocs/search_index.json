Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero.\n\n\nIf data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools.\n\n\nEverything else about the \ncompute\n API can be found at the\n\nofficial documentation site\n.\n\n\nDownloads\n\n\nYou can download the pre-compiled 64bit binaries for the following platforms:\n\n\n\n\n \nubuntu\n\n\n \nosx\n\n\n\n\nFind the source code \non github\n.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nThis documentation was generated from the \ncompute\n API at revision \n20160120\n.

Each scope\n            requires the user to grant this application permission to use it.\n            If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method.\n  --config-dir \nfolder\n\n            A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to\n            a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation.\n            [default: ~/.google-service-cli]\n  --debug\n            Output all server communication to standard error. `tx` and `rx` are placed\n            into the same stream.\n  --debug-auth\n            Output all communication related to authentication to standard error. `tx`\n            and `rx` are placed into the same stream.\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nThe program will store all persistent data in the \n~/.google-service-cli\n directory in \nJSON\n files prefixed with \ncompute1-\n.  You can change the directory used to store configuration with the \n--config-dir\n flag on a per-invocation basis.\n\n\nMore information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMost APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the \nscope\n determines the \nset of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/compute1-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/compute1-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \ncompute\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \ncompute1 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.\n\n\nThe field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.\n\n\nFor example, filter=name ne example-instance.\n\n\nCompute Engine Beta API Only: If you use filtering in the Beta API, you can also filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. In particular, use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of instance labels to organize and filter results based on label values.\n\n\nThe Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p page-token=string\n\n\n\n\nSpecifies a page token to use.

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. .

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .    creation-timestamp=clita\n\n\n[Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndescription=consetetur\n\n\nAn optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndisk-size-gb=takimata\n\n\n[Output Only] Size of the snapshot, specified in GB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid=nonumy\n\n\n[Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkind=kasd\n\n\n[Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#snapshot for Snapshot resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlicenses=sanctus\n\n\nPublic visible licenses.\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname=takimata\n\n\nName of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression \na-z\n? which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nself-link=at\n\n\n[Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsource-disk=labore\n\n\n[Output Only] The source disk used to create this snapshot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsource-disk-id=invidunt\n\n\n[Output Only] The ID value of the disk used to create this snapshot. This value may be used to determine whether the snapshot was taken from the current or a previous instance of a given disk name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstatus=ea\n\n\n[Output Only] The status of the snapshot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstorage-bytes=sadipscing\n\n\n[Output Only] A size of the the storage used by the snapshot.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.   -r .    creation-timestamp=dolore  [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.    description=nonumy  An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.    id=sed  [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.    kind=aliquyam  [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#disk for disks.    last-attach-timestamp=sit  [Output Only] Last attach timestamp in RFC3339 text format.    last-detach-timestamp=eirmod  [Output Only] Last detach timestamp in RFC3339 text format.    licenses=consetetur  Any applicable publicly visible licenses.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    name=labore  Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression  a-z ? which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.    options=sed  Internal use only.    self-link=ea  [Output Only] Server-defined fully-qualified URL for this resource.    size-gb=gubergren   Size of the persistent disk, specified in GB. You can specify this field when creating a persistent disk using the sourceImage or sourceSnapshot parameter, or specify it alone to create an empty persistent disk.  If you specify this field along with sourceImage or sourceSnapshot, the value of sizeGb must not be less than the size of the sourceImage or the size of the snapshot.\n*  source-image=aliquyam \n    - The source image used to create this disk. If the source image is deleted from the system, this field will not be set, even if an image with the same name has been re-created.  When creating a disk, you can provide a private (custom) image using the following input, and Compute Engine will use the corresponding image from your project. For example:  global/images/my-private-image   Or you can provide an image from a publicly-available project. For example, to use a Debian image from the debian-cloud project, make sure to include the project in the URL:  projects/debian-cloud/global/images/debian-7-wheezy-vYYYYMMDD   where vYYYYMMDD is the image version. The fully-qualified URL will also work in both cases.   source-image-id=eos \n    - The ID value of the image used to create this disk. This value identifies the exact image that was used to create this persistent disk. For example, if you created the persistent disk from an image that was later deleted and recreated under the same name, the source image ID would identify the exact version of the image that was used.   source-snapshot=tempor \n    - The source snapshot used to create this disk. You can provide this as a partial or full URL to the resource. For example, the following are valid values: \n- https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/global/snapshots/snapshot \n- projects/project/global/snapshots/snapshot \n- global/snapshots/snapshot   source-snapshot-id=sea \n    - [Output Only] The unique ID of the snapshot used to create this disk. This value identifies the exact snapshot that was used to create this persistent disk. For example, if you created the persistent disk from a snapshot that was later deleted and recreated under the same name, the source snapshot ID would identify the exact version of the snapshot that was used.   status=labore \n    - [Output Only] The status of disk creation. Applicable statuses includes: CREATING, FAILED, READY, RESTORING.   type=ipsum \n    - URL of the disk type resource describing which disk type to use to create the disk; provided by the client when the disk is created.   users=aliquyam \n    - Links to the users of the disk (attached instances) in form: project/zones/zone/instances/instance\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n*  zone=dolores \n    - [Output Only] URL of the zone where the disk resides.      About Cursors  The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:   The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the  .  character. Fields can be nested such as in  -r f.s.o  .  The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. . Each additional  .  moves it up one additional level. E.g.  ...  would go three levels up.",

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nForwardingRule:\n  ip-address: string\n  ip-protocol: string\n  creation-timestamp: string\n  description: string\n  id: string\n  kind: string\n  name: string\n  port-range: string\n  region: string\n  self-link: string\n  target: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .    ip-address=invidunt\n\n\nValue of the reserved IP address that this forwarding rule is serving on behalf of. For global forwarding rules, the address must be a global IP; for regional forwarding rules, the address must live in the same region as the forwarding rule. If left empty (default value), an ephemeral IP from the same scope (global or regional) will be assigned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nip-protocol=eirmod\n\n\nThe IP protocol to which this rule applies. Valid options are TCP, UDP, ESP, AH or SCTP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncreation-timestamp=at\n\n\n[Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndescription=consetetur\n\n\nAn optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid=et\n\n\n[Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkind=sed\n\n\n[Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#forwardingRule for Forwarding Rule resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname=sit\n\n\nName of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression \na-z\n? which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nport-range=takimata\n\n\nApplicable only when IPProtocol is TCP, UDP, or SCTP, only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to target. Forwarding rules with the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair must have disjoint port ranges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nregion=elitr\n\n\n[Output Only] URL of the region where the regional forwarding rule resides. This field is not applicable to global forwarding rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nself-link=nonumy\n\n\n[Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntarget=rebum.\n\n\nThe URL of the target resource to receive the matched traffic. For regional forwarding rules, this target must live in the same region as the forwarding rule. For global forwarding rules, this target must be a global TargetHttpProxy or TargetHttpsProxy resource. The forwarded traffic must be of a type appropriate to the target object. For example, TargetHttpProxy requires HTTP traffic, and TargetHttpsProxy requires HTTPS traffic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly.

For example, a structure like this:  ForwardingRule:\n  ip-address: string\n  ip-protocol: string\n  creation-timestamp: string\n  description: string\n  id: string\n  kind: string\n  name: string\n  port-range: string\n  region: string\n  self-link: string\n  target: string  can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.   -r .    ip-address=invidunt  Value of the reserved IP address that this forwarding rule is serving on behalf of. For global forwarding rules, the address must be a global IP; for regional forwarding rules, the address must live in the same region as the forwarding rule. If left empty (default value), an ephemeral IP from the same scope (global or regional) will be assigned.    ip-protocol=eirmod  The IP protocol to which this rule applies. Valid options are TCP, UDP, ESP, AH or SCTP.    creation-timestamp=at  [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.    description=consetetur  An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.    id=et  [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.    kind=sed  [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#forwardingRule for Forwarding Rule resources.    name=sit  Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression  a-z ? which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.    port-range=takimata  Applicable only when IPProtocol is TCP, UDP, or SCTP, only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to target. Forwarding rules with the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair must have disjoint port ranges.    region=elitr  [Output Only] URL of the region where the regional forwarding rule resides. This field is not applicable to global forwarding rules.    self-link=nonumy  [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.    target=rebum.  The URL of the target resource to receive the matched traffic. For regional forwarding rules, this target must live in the same region as the forwarding rule. For global forwarding rules, this target must be a global TargetHttpProxy or TargetHttpsProxy resource. The forwarded traffic must be of a type appropriate to the target object. For example, TargetHttpProxy requires HTTP traffic, and TargetHttpsProxy requires HTTPS traffic.     About Cursors  The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:   The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the  .  character. Fields can be nested such as in  -r f.s.o  .  The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. . Each additional  .  moves it up one additional level. E.g.  ...  would go three levels up.",

Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.\n\n\nFor example, filter=name ne example-instance.\n\n\nCompute Engine Beta API Only: If you use filtering in the Beta API, you can also filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. In particular, use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of instance labels to organize and filter results based on label values.\n\n\nThe Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f).

The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.  For example, filter=name ne example-instance.  Compute Engine Beta API Only: If you use filtering in the Beta API, you can also filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. In particular, use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of instance labels to organize and filter results based on label values.  The Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f).

About Cursors  The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:   The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the  .  character. Fields can be nested such as in  -r f.s.o  .  The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. . Each additional  .  moves it up one additional level. E.g.  ...  would go three levels up.",

Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.      -p page-token=string   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.     -p max-results=integer   The maximum number of results per page that Compute Engine should return. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.",

Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.\n\n\nFor example, filter=name ne example-instance.\n\n\nCompute Engine Beta API Only: If you use filtering in the Beta API, you can also filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.  For example, a structure like this:  HttpsHealthCheck:\n  check-interval-sec: integer\n  creation-timestamp: string\n  description: string\n  healthy-threshold: integer\n  host: string\n  id: string\n  kind: string\n  name: string\n  port: integer\n  request-path: string\n  self-link: string\n  timeout-sec: integer\n  unhealthy-threshold: integer  can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.   -r .    check-interval-sec=64  How often (in seconds) to send a health check. The default value is 5 seconds.    creation-timestamp=accusam  [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.    description=labore  An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.    healthy-threshold=22  A so-far unhealthy instance will be marked healthy after this many consecutive successes. The default value is 2.    host=nonumy  The value of the host header in the HTTPS health check request. If left empty (default value), the public IP on behalf of which this health check is performed will be used.    id=sed  [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.    kind=diam  Type of the resource.    name=magna  Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression  a-z ? which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.    port=2  The TCP port number for the HTTPS health check request. The default value is 443.    request-path=lorem  The request path of the HTTPS health check request. The default value is  / .    self-link=dolor  [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.    timeout-sec=76  How long (in seconds) to wait before claiming failure. The default value is 5 seconds. It is invalid for timeoutSec to have a greater value than checkIntervalSec.    unhealthy-threshold=10  A so-far healthy instance will be marked unhealthy after this many consecutive failures. The default value is 2.     About Cursors  The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:   The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the  .  character. Fields can be nested such as in  -r f.s.o  .  The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. . Each additional  .  moves it up one additional level. E.g.  ...  would go three levels up.",

Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.  The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.  For example, filter=name ne example-instance.  Compute Engine Beta API Only: If you use filtering in the Beta API, you can also filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. In particular, use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of instance labels to organize and filter results based on label values.  The Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f).

If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.     -p page-token=string   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.",

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nAttachedDisk:\n  auto-delete: boolean\n  boot: boolean\n  device-name: string\n  index: integer\n  initialize-params:\n    disk-name: string\n    disk-size-gb: string\n    disk-type: string\n    source-image: string\n  interface: string\n  kind: string\n  licenses: [string]\n  mode: string\n  source: string\n  type: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .    auto-delete=false\n\n\nSpecifies whether the disk will be auto-deleted when the instance is deleted (but not when the disk is detached from the instance).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nboot=true\n\n\nIndicates that this is a boot disk. The virtual machine will use the first partition of the disk for its root filesystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndevice-name=ut\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifies a unique device name of your choice that is reflected into the /dev/disk/by-id/google-* tree of a Linux operating system running within the instance. This name can be used to reference the device for mounting, resizing, and so on, from within the instance.\n\n\nIf not specified, the server chooses a default device name to apply to this disk, in the form persistent-disks-x, where x is a number assigned by Google Compute Engine. This field is only applicable for persistent disks.\n\n \nindex=54\n\n    - Assigns a zero-based index to this disk, where 0 is reserved for the boot disk. For example, if you have many disks attached to an instance, each disk would have a unique index number. If not specified, the server will choose an appropriate value.\n\n \ninitialize-params    disk-name=sed\n\n    - Specifies the disk name. If not specified, the default is to use the name of the instance.\n\n \ndisk-size-gb=sit\n\n    - Specifies the size of the disk in base-2 GB.\n\n \ndisk-type=sit\n\n    - Specifies the disk type to use to create the instance. If not specified, the default is pd-standard, specified using the full URL. For example:\n\n\nhttps://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/zones/zone/diskTypes/pd-standard \n\n\nOther values include pd-ssd and local-ssd. If you define this field, you can provide either the full or partial URL. For example, the following are valid values:\n\n- https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/zones/zone/diskTypes/diskType \n- projects/project/zones/zone/diskTypes/diskType \n- zones/zone/diskTypes/diskType\n* \nsource-image=dolores\n\n    - A source image used to create the disk. You can provide a private (custom) image, and Compute Engine will use the corresponding image from your project. For example:\n\n\nglobal/images/my-private-image \n\n\nOr you can provide an image from a publicly-available project. For example, to use a Debian image from the debian-cloud project, make sure to include the project in the URL:\n\n\nprojects/debian-cloud/global/images/debian-7-wheezy-vYYYYMMDD \n\n\nwhere vYYYYMMDD is the image version. The fully-qualified URL will also work in both cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    interface=et\n\n\n\n\nSpecifies the disk interface to use for attaching this disk, either SCSI or NVME. The default is SCSI. For performance characteristics of SCSI over NVMe, see Local SSD performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkind=sanctus\n\n\n[Output Only] Type of the resource.

If not specified, the default is to attach the disk in READ_WRITE mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsource=ut\n\n\nSpecifies a valid partial or full URL to an existing Persistent Disk resource. This field is only applicable for persistent disks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntype=sadipscing\n\n\nSpecifies the type of the disk, either SCRATCH or PERSISTENT. If not specified, the default is PERSISTENT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.  For example, filter=name ne example-instance.  Compute Engine Beta API Only: If you use filtering in the Beta API, you can also filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. In particular, use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of instance labels to organize and filter results based on label values.  The Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f).

The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression \na-z\n? which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnetwork=amet\n\n\nFully-qualified URL of the network that this route applies to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnext-hop-gateway=lorem\n\n\nThe URL to a gateway that should handle matching packets. You can only specify the internet gateway using a full or partial valid URL:  projects/\nproject-id\n/global/gateways/default-internet-gateway\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnext-hop-instance=eirmod\n\n\nThe URL to an instance that should handle matching packets.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.  For example, a structure like this:  Route:\n  creation-timestamp: string\n  description: string\n  dest-range: string\n  id: string\n  kind: string\n  name: string\n  network: string\n  next-hop-gateway: string\n  next-hop-instance: string\n  next-hop-ip: string\n  next-hop-network: string\n  next-hop-vpn-tunnel: string\n  priority: integer\n  self-link: string\n  tags: [string]  can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.   -r .    creation-timestamp=erat  [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.    description=erat  An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.    dest-range=voluptua.  The destination range of outgoing packets that this route applies to.    id=est  [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.    kind=consetetur  [Output Only] Type of this resource. Always compute#routes for Route resources.    name=tempor  Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression  a-z ? which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.    network=amet  Fully-qualified URL of the network that this route applies to.    next-hop-gateway=lorem  The URL to a gateway that should handle matching packets. You can only specify the internet gateway using a full or partial valid URL:  projects/ project-id /global/gateways/default-internet-gateway    next-hop-instance=eirmod  The URL to an instance that should handle matching packets. You can specify this as a full or partial URL. For example:\n    https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/zones/zone/instances/    next-hop-ip=elitr  The network IP address of an instance that should handle matching packets.    next-hop-network=clita  The URL of the local network if it should handle matching packets.    next-hop-vpn-tunnel=et  The URL to a VpnTunnel that should handle matching packets.    priority=62  The priority of this route. Priority is used to break ties in cases where there is more than one matching route of equal prefix length. In the case of two routes with equal prefix length, the one with the lowest-numbered priority value wins. Default value is 1000. Valid range is 0 through 65535.    self-link=ea  [Output Only] Server-defined fully-qualified URL for this resource.    tags=et  A list of instance tags to which this route applies.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.     About Cursors  The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:   The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the  .  character. Fields can be nested such as in  -r f.s.o  .  The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. . Each additional  .  moves it up one additional level. E.g.  ...  would go three levels up.",

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nSslCertificate:\n  certificate: string\n  creation-timestamp: string\n  description: string\n  id: string\n  kind: string\n  name: string\n  private-key: string\n  self-link: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .    certificate=sed\n\n\nA local certificate file. The certificate must be in PEM format. The certificate chain must be no greater than 5 certs long. The chain must include at least one intermediate cert.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncreation-timestamp=sanctus\n\n\n[Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndescription=sea\n\n\nAn optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid=ipsum\n\n\n[Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkind=gubergren\n\n\n[Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#sslCertificate for SSL certificates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname=eos\n\n\nName of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression \na-z\n? which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprivate-key=sed\n\n\nA write-only private key in PEM format. Only insert RPCs will include this field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nself-link=sit\n\n\n[Output only] Server-defined URL for the resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.  For example, a structure like this:  SslCertificate:\n  certificate: string\n  creation-timestamp: string\n  description: string\n  id: string\n  kind: string\n  name: string\n  private-key: string\n  self-link: string  can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.   -r .    certificate=sed  A local certificate file. The certificate must be in PEM format. The certificate chain must be no greater than 5 certs long. The chain must include at least one intermediate cert.    creation-timestamp=sanctus  [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.    description=sea  An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.    id=ipsum  [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.    kind=gubergren  [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#sslCertificate for SSL certificates.    name=eos  Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression  a-z ? which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.    private-key=sed  A write-only private key in PEM format. Only insert RPCs will include this field.    self-link=sit  [Output only] Server-defined URL for the resource.     About Cursors  The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:   The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the  .  character. Fields can be nested such as in  -r f.s.o  .  The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. . Each additional  .  moves it up one additional level. E.g.  ...  would go three levels up.",

Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.\n\n\nThe field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.\n\n\nFor example, filter=name ne example-instance.\n\n\nCompute Engine Beta API Only: If you use filtering in the Beta API, you can also filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. In particular, use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of instance labels to organize and filter results based on label values.\n\n\nThe Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p max-results=integer\n\n\n\n\nThe maximum number of results per page that Compute Engine should return.

Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.     -p filter=string    Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.  The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.  For example, filter=name ne example-instance.  Compute Engine Beta API Only: If you use filtering in the Beta API, you can also filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. In particular, use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of instance labels to organize and filter results based on label values.  The Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.      -p max-results=integer   The maximum number of results per page that Compute Engine should return. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.",

Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax.

For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. In particular, use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of instance labels to organize and filter results based on label values.\n\n\nThe Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f).

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.   -r .    backup-pool=tempor   This field is applicable only when the containing target pool is serving a forwarding rule as the primary pool, and its failoverRatio field is properly set to a value between [0, 1].  backupPool and failoverRatio together define the fallback behavior of the primary target pool: if the ratio of the healthy instances in the primary pool is at or below failoverRatio, traffic arriving at the load-balanced IP will be directed to the backup pool.  In case where failoverRatio and backupPool are not set, or all the instances in the backup pool are unhealthy, the traffic will be directed back to the primary pool in the  force  mode, where traffic will be spread to the healthy instances with the best effort, or to all instances when no instance is healthy.   creation-timestamp=justo \n    - [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.   description=takimata \n    - An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.\n*  failover-ratio=0.636588116969 \n    - This field is applicable only when the containing target pool is serving a forwarding rule as the primary pool (i.e., not as a backup pool to some other target pool). The value of the field must be in [0, 1].  If set, backupPool must also be set. They together define the fallback behavior of the primary target pool: if the ratio of the healthy instances in the primary pool is at or below this number, traffic arriving at the load-balanced IP will be directed to the backup pool.  In case where failoverRatio is not set or all the instances in the backup pool are unhealthy, the traffic will be directed back to the primary pool in the  force  mode, where traffic will be spread to the healthy instances with the best effort, or to all instances when no instance is healthy.   health-checks=amet \n    - A list of URLs to the HttpHealthCheck resource. A member instance in this pool is considered healthy if and only if all specified health checks pass. An empty list means all member instances will be considered healthy at all times.\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.   id=dolor \n    - [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.   instances=voluptua. \n    - A list of resource URLs to the member virtual machines serving this pool. They must live in zones contained in the same region as this pool.\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.   kind=et \n    - [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#targetPool for target pools.   name=elitr \n    - Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression  a-z ? which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.   region=kasd \n    - [Output Only] URL of the region where the target pool resides.   self-link=sit \n    - [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.   session-affinity=justo \n    - Sesssion affinity option, must be one of the following values:\nNONE: Connections from the same client IP may go to any instance in the pool.\nCLIENT_IP: Connections from the same client IP will go to the same instance in the pool while that instance remains healthy.\nCLIENT_IP_PROTO: Connections from the same client IP with the same IP protocol will go to the same instance in the pool while that instance remains healthy.      About Cursors  The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:   The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the  .  character. Fields can be nested such as in  -r f.s.o  .  The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. . Each additional  .  moves it up one additional level. E.g.  ...  would go three levels up.",

Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.\n\n\nFor example, filter=name ne example-instance.\n\n\nCompute Engine Beta API Only: If you use filtering in the Beta API, you can also filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. In particular, use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of instance labels to organize and filter results based on label values.\n\n\nThe Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p page-token=string\n\n\n\n\nSpecifies a page token to use.

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. .

For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. In particular, use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of instance labels to organize and filter results based on label values.  The Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.      -p max-results=integer   The maximum number of results per page that Compute Engine should return. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.     -p page-token=string   Specifies a page token to use.

Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.  The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.  For example, filter=name ne example-instance.  Compute Engine Beta API Only: If you use filtering in the Beta API, you can also filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. In particular, use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of instance labels to organize and filter results based on label values.  The Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.      -p max-results=integer   The maximum number of results per page that Compute Engine should return.

Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero.\n\n\nIf data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools.\n\n\nEverything else about the \ncompute\n API can be found at the\n\nofficial documentation site\n.\n\n\nInstallation and Source Code\n\n\nInstall the command-line interface with cargo using:\n\n\ncargo install google-compute1-cli\n\n\n\n\nFind the source code \non github\n.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nThis documentation was generated from the \ncompute\n API at revision \n20180916\n.

Each scope\n            requires the user to grant this application permission to use it.\n            If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method.\n  --config-dir \nfolder\n\n            A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to\n            a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation.\n            [default: ~/.google-service-cli]\n  --debug\n            Output all server communication to standard error. `tx` and `rx` are placed\n            into the same stream.\n  --debug-auth\n            Output all communication related to authentication to standard error. `tx`\n            and `rx` are placed into the same stream.\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nThe program will store all persistent data in the \n~/.google-service-cli\n directory in \nJSON\n files prefixed with \ncompute1-\n.  You can change the directory used to store configuration with the \n--config-dir\n flag on a per-invocation basis.\n\n\nMore information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMost APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the \nscope\n determines the \nset of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/compute1-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/compute1-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \ncompute\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \ncompute1 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call.

Default is 30 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that \n-p\n is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this \n-p k1=v1 k2=v2\n even though the listing below repeats the\n\n-p\n for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n-p request-id=string\n\n\n\n\nAn optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.\n\n\nFor example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.\n\n\nThe request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=,  , or  .  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform =  Intel Skylake ). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform =  Intel Skylake ) OR (cpuPlatform =  Intel Broadwell ) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).      -p max-results=integer   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.

Default is 30 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that \n-p\n is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this \n-p k1=v1 k2=v2\n even though the listing below repeats the\n\n-p\n for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n-p request-id=string\n\n\n\n\nAn optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.\n\n\nFor example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.\n\n\nThe request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

The TCP port to connect on the backend. The default value is 80.  This cannot be used for internal load balancing.\n*  port-name=sed \n    - Name of backend port. The same name should appear in the instance groups referenced by this service. Required when the load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL.  When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, this field is not used.\n*  protocol=et \n    - The protocol this BackendService uses to communicate with backends.  Possible values are HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and SSL. The default is HTTP.  For internal load balancing, the possible values are TCP and UDP, and the default is TCP.   region=ipsum \n    - [Output Only] URL of the region where the regional backend service resides. This field is not applicable to global backend services. You must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL.

This value may be used to determine whether the snapshot was taken from the current or a previous instance of a given disk name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstatus=dolores\n\n\n[Output Only] The status of the snapshot. This can be CREATING, DELETING, FAILED, READY, or UPLOADING.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstorage-bytes=consetetur\n\n\n[Output Only] A size of the storage used by the snapshot. As snapshots share storage, this number is expected to change with snapshot creation/deletion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstorage-bytes-status=dolor\n\n\n[Output Only] An indicator whether storageBytes is in a stable state or it is being adjusted as a result of shared storage reallocation.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character.

Provide this property when you create the resource.    disk-size-gb=nonumy  [Output Only] Size of the snapshot, specified in GB.    id=et  [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.    kind=sed  [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#snapshot for Snapshot resources.     label-fingerprint=no    A fingerprint for the labels being applied to this snapshot, which is essentially a hash of the labels set used for optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels.

This can be because the original image had licenses attached (such as a Windows image).\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.   name=aliquyam \n    - Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression  [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?  which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.   self-link=elitr \n    - [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.   snapshot-encryption-key    kms-key-name=consetetur \n    - The name of the encryption key that is stored in Google Cloud KMS.   raw-key=sea \n    - Specifies a 256-bit customer-supplied encryption key, encoded in RFC 4648 base64 to either encrypt or decrypt this resource.   sha256=elitr \n    - [Output only] The RFC 4648 base64 encoded SHA-256 hash of the customer-supplied encryption key that protects this resource.      ..    source-disk=at   [Output Only] The source disk used to create this snapshot.    source-disk-encryption-key    kms-key-name=sea  The name of the encryption key that is stored in Google Cloud KMS.    raw-key=consetetur  Specifies a 256-bit customer-supplied encryption key, encoded in RFC 4648 base64 to either encrypt or decrypt this resource.     sha256=diam   [Output only] The RFC 4648 base64 encoded SHA-256 hash of the customer-supplied encryption key that protects this resource.     ..    source-disk-id=accusam   [Output Only] The ID value of the disk used to create this snapshot. This value may be used to determine whether the snapshot was taken from the current or a previous instance of a given disk name.    status=dolores  [Output Only] The status of the snapshot. This can be CREATING, DELETING, FAILED, READY, or UPLOADING.    storage-bytes=consetetur  [Output Only] A size of the storage used by the snapshot. As snapshots share storage, this number is expected to change with snapshot creation/deletion.    storage-bytes-status=dolor  [Output Only] An indicator whether storageBytes is in a stable state or it is being adjusted as a result of shared storage reallocation.

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that \n-p\n is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this \n-p k1=v1 k2=v2\n even though the listing below repeats the\n\n-p\n for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p request-id=string\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.\n\n\nFor example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.\n\n\nThe request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p source-image=string\n\n\n\n\nOptional.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.  For example, a structure like this:  Firewall:\n  creation-timestamp: string\n  description: string\n  destination-ranges: [string]\n  direction: string\n  disabled: boolean\n  id: string\n  kind: string\n  name: string\n  network: string\n  priority: integer\n  self-link: string\n  source-ranges: [string]\n  source-service-accounts: [string]\n  source-tags: [string]\n  target-service-accounts: [string]\n  target-tags: [string]  can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.   -r .    creation-timestamp=magna  [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.    description=gubergren  An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.    destination-ranges=sit  If destination ranges are specified, the firewall will apply only to traffic that has destination IP address in these ranges. These ranges must be expressed in CIDR format. Only IPv4 is supported.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    direction=gubergren  Direction of traffic to which this firewall applies; default is INGRESS. Note: For INGRESS traffic, it is NOT supported to specify destinationRanges; For EGRESS traffic, it is NOT supported to specify sourceRanges OR sourceTags.    disabled=true  Denotes whether the firewall rule is disabled, i.e not applied to the network it is associated with. When set to true, the firewall rule is not enforced and the network behaves as if it did not exist. If this is unspecified, the firewall rule will be enabled.    id=amet  [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.    kind=eirmod  [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#firewall for firewall rules.    name=sanctus  Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression  [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?  which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.    network=lorem  URL of the network resource for this firewall rule. If not specified when creating a firewall rule, the default network is used:\n    global/networks/default\n    If you choose to specify this property, you can specify the network as a full or partial URL. For example, the following are all valid URLs:    https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/global/networks/my-network   projects/myproject/global/networks/my-network   global/networks/default      priority=100  Priority for this rule. This is an integer between 0 and 65535, both inclusive. When not specified, the value assumed is 1000. Relative priorities determine precedence of conflicting rules. Lower value of priority implies higher precedence (eg, a rule with priority 0 has higher precedence than a rule with priority 1). DENY rules take precedence over ALLOW rules having equal priority.    self-link=diam  [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.    source-ranges=eirmod  If source ranges are specified, the firewall will apply only to traffic that has source IP address in these ranges. These ranges must be expressed in CIDR format. One or both of sourceRanges and sourceTags may be set. If both properties are set, the firewall will apply to traffic that has source IP address within sourceRanges OR the source IP that belongs to a tag listed in the sourceTags property. The connection does not need to match both properties for the firewall to apply. Only IPv4 is supported.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    source-service-accounts=sadipscing  If source service accounts are specified, the firewall will apply only to traffic originating from an instance with a service account in this list. Source service accounts cannot be used to control traffic to an instance s external IP address because service accounts are associated with an instance, not an IP address. sourceRanges can be set at the same time as sourceServiceAccounts. If both are set, the firewall will apply to traffic that has source IP address within sourceRanges OR the source IP belongs to an instance with service account listed in sourceServiceAccount. The connection does not need to match both properties for the firewall to apply. sourceServiceAccounts cannot be used at the same time as sourceTags or targetTags.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    source-tags=lorem  If source tags are specified, the firewall rule applies only to traffic with source IPs that match the primary network interfaces of VM instances that have the tag and are in the same VPC network. Source tags cannot be used to control traffic to an instance s external IP address, it only applies to traffic between instances in the same virtual network. Because tags are associated with instances, not IP addresses. One or both of sourceRanges and sourceTags may be set. If both properties are set, the firewall will apply to traffic that has source IP address within sourceRanges OR the source IP that belongs to a tag listed in the sourceTags property. The connection does not need to match both properties for the firewall to apply.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    target-service-accounts=sed  A list of service accounts indicating sets of instances located in the network that may make network connections as specified in allowed[]. targetServiceAccounts cannot be used at the same time as targetTags or sourceTags. If neither targetServiceAccounts nor targetTags are specified, the firewall rule applies to all instances on the specified network.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    target-tags=sit  A list of tags that controls which instances the firewall rule applies to. If targetTags are specified, then the firewall rule applies only to instances in the VPC network that have one of those tags. If no targetTags are specified, the firewall rule applies to all instances on the specified network.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.",

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that \n-p\n is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this \n-p k1=v1 k2=v2\n even though the listing below repeats the\n\n-p\n for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n-p request-id=string\n\n\n\n\nAn optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.\n\n\nFor example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.\n\n\nThe request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nForwardingRule:\n  ip-address: string\n  ip-protocol: string\n  backend-service: string\n  creation-timestamp: string\n  description: string\n  id: string\n  ip-version: string\n  kind: string\n  load-balancing-scheme: string\n  name: string\n  network: string\n  network-tier: string\n  port-range: string\n  ports: [string]\n  region: string\n  self-link: string\n  subnetwork: string\n  target: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .    ip-address=voluptua.\n\n\n\n\nThe IP address that this forwarding rule is serving on behalf of.\n\n\nAddresses are restricted based on the forwarding rule\ns load balancing scheme (EXTERNAL or INTERNAL) and scope (global or regional).\n\n\nWhen the load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL, for global forwarding rules, the address must be a global IP, and for regional forwarding rules, the address must live in the same region as the forwarding rule. If this field is empty, an ephemeral IPv4 address from the same scope (global or regional) will be assigned. A regional forwarding rule supports IPv4 only. A global forwarding rule supports either IPv4 or IPv6.\n\n\nWhen the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, this must be a URL reference to an existing Address resource ( internal regional static IP address), with a purpose of GCE_END_POINT and address_type of INTERNAL.\n\n\nWhen the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, this can only be an RFC 1918 IP address belonging to the network/subnet configured for the forwarding rule. By default, if this field is empty, an ephemeral internal IP address will be automatically allocated from the IP range of the subnet or network configured for this forwarding rule.\n\n\nAn address can be specified either by a literal IP address or a URL reference to an existing Address resource. The following examples are all valid:\n\n- 100.1.2.3 \n- https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/regions/region/addresses/address \n- projects/project/regions/region/addresses/address \n- regions/region/addresses/address \n- global/addresses/address \n- address\n* \nip-protocol=takimata\n\n    - The IP protocol to which this rule applies. Valid options are TCP, UDP, ESP, AH, SCTP or ICMP.\n\n\nWhen the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, only TCP and UDP are valid. When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, only TCPis valid.\n* \nbackend-service=dolor\n\n    - This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.\n\n\nFor internal load balancing, this field identifies the BackendService resource to receive the matched traffic.\n\n \ncreation-timestamp=takimata\n\n    - [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.\n\n \ndescription=voluptua.\n\n    - An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.\n\n \nid=no\n\n    - [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that \n-p\n is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this \n-p k1=v1 k2=v2\n even though the listing below repeats the\n\n-p\n for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n-p request-id=string\n\n\n\n\nAn optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.\n\n\nFor example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.\n\n\nThe request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=,  , or  .  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform =  Intel Skylake ). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform =  Intel Skylake ) OR (cpuPlatform =  Intel Broadwell ) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).      -p order-by=string    Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy= creationTimestamp desc . This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.",

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that \n-p\n is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this \n-p k1=v1 k2=v2\n even though the listing below repeats the\n\n-p\n for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n-p request-id=string\n\n\n\n\nAn optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.\n\n\nFor example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.\n\n\nThe request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call.

Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.\n\n\nFor example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.\n\n\nThe request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression \n[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?\n which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nport=94\n\n\nThe TCP port number for the HTTPS health check request.

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level.

If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.\n\n\nThe request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.     -p max-results=integer   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)     -p order-by=string    Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy= creationTimestamp desc . This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.      -p filter=string    A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=,  , or  .  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform =  Intel Skylake ). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform =  Intel Skylake ) OR (cpuPlatform =  Intel Broadwell ) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).",

Possible values are FAILED, PENDING, or READY.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that \n-p\n is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this \n-p k1=v1 k2=v2\n even though the listing below repeats the\n\n-p\n for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p request-id=string\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.\n\n\nFor example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.\n\n\nThe request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p force-create=boolean\n\n\n\n\nForce image creation if true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform =  Intel Skylake ). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform =  Intel Skylake ) OR (cpuPlatform =  Intel Broadwell ) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).",

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level.

Please note that \n-p\n is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this \n-p k1=v1 k2=v2\n even though the listing below repeats the\n\n-p\n for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n-p request-id=string\n\n\n\n\nAn optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.\n\n\nFor example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.\n\n\nThe request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n.

Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.\n\n\nFor example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.\n\n\nThe request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level.

Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.\n\n\nFor example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.\n\n\nThe request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p force-attach=boolean\n\n\n\n\nWhether to force attach the disk even if it\ns currently attached to another instance.

You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change labels.\n\n\nTo see the latest fingerprint, make get() request to the instance.\n\n \nlabels=key=lorem\n\n    - Labels to apply to this instance. These can be later modified by the setLabels method.\n    - the value will be associated with the given \nkey\n\n\n \nmachine-type=kasd\n\n    - Full or partial URL of the machine type resource to use for this instance, in the format: zones/zone/machineTypes/machine-type. This is provided by the client when the instance is created. For example, the following is a valid partial url to a predefined machine type:\nzones/us-central1-f/machineTypes/n1-standard-1\n\n\nTo create a custom machine type, provide a URL to a machine type in the following format, where CPUS is 1 or an even number up to 32 (2, 4, 6, ... 24, etc), and MEMORY is the total memory for this instance. Memory must be a multiple of 256 MB and must be supplied in MB (e.g. 5 GB of memory is 5120 MB):\nzones/zone/machineTypes/custom-CPUS-MEMORY\n\n\nFor example: zones/us-central1-f/machineTypes/custom-4-5120 \n\n\nFor a full list of restrictions, read the Specifications for custom machine types.\n* \nmetadata    fingerprint=nonumy\n\n    - Specifies a fingerprint for this request, which is essentially a hash of the metadata\ns contents and used for optimistic locking.

Applicable values are the friendly names of CPU platforms, such as minCpuPlatform: \nIntel Haswell\n or minCpuPlatform: \nIntel Sandy Bridge\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname=no\n\n\nThe name of the resource, provided by the client when initially creating the resource. The resource name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression \n[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?\n which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscheduling    automatic-restart=true\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifies whether the instance should be automatically restarted if it is terminated by Compute Engine (not terminated by a user). You can only set the automatic restart option for standard instances. Preemptible instances cannot be automatically restarted.\n\n\nBy default, this is set to true so an instance is automatically restarted if it is terminated by Compute Engine.\n\n \non-host-maintenance=dolor\n\n    - Defines the maintenance behavior for this instance. For standard instances, the default behavior is MIGRATE. For preemptible instances, the default and only possible behavior is TERMINATE. For more information, see Setting Instance Scheduling Options.\n\n \npreemptible=true\n\n    - Defines whether the instance is preemptible. This can only be set during instance creation, it cannot be set or changed after the instance has been created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    self-link=ipsum\n\n\n\n\n[Output Only] Server-defined URL for this resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstart-restricted=true\n\n\n[Output Only] Whether a VM has been restricted for start because Compute Engine has detected suspicious activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstatus=aliquyam\n\n\n[Output Only] The status of the instance. One of the following values: PROVISIONING, STAGING, RUNNING, STOPPING, STOPPED, SUSPENDING, SUSPENDED, and TERMINATED.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstatus-message=lorem\n\n\n[Output Only] An optional, human-readable explanation of the status.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntags    fingerprint=dolores\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifies a fingerprint for this request, which is essentially a hash of the tags\n contents and used for optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update tags. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change tags.\n\n\nTo see the latest fingerprint, make get() request to the instance.\n* \nitems=dolores\n\n    - An array of tags. Each tag must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    zone=accusam\n\n\n\n\n[Output Only] URL of the zone where the instance resides. You must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is not settable as a field in the request body.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that \n-p\n is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this \n-p k1=v1 k2=v2\n even though the listing below repeats the\n\n-p\n for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p source-instance-template=string\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifies instance template to create the instance.\n\n\nThis field is optional. It can be a full or partial URL. For example, the following are all valid URLs to an instance template:\n\n- https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/global/instanceTemplates/instanceTemplate \n- projects/project/global/instanceTemplates/instanceTemplate \n- global/instanceTemplates/instanceTemplate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p request-id=string\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.\n\n\nFor example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.\n\n\nThe request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

Please note that  -p  is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this  -p k1=v1 k2=v2  even though the listing below repeats the -p  for completeness.    -p filter=string    A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=,  , or  .  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform =  Intel Skylake ). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform =  Intel Skylake ) OR (cpuPlatform =  Intel Broadwell ) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).      -p page-token=string   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.     -p order-by=string    Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy= creationTimestamp desc . This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.      -p max-results=integer   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)",

This field refers to 802.1q VLAN tag, also known as IEEE 802.1Q Only specified at creation time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call.

Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.\n\n\nFor example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.\n\n\nThe request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform =  Intel Skylake ). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform =  Intel Skylake ) OR (cpuPlatform =  Intel Broadwell ) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).",

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n.

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly.

By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.\n\n\nYou can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy=\ncreationTimestamp desc\n. This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.\n\n\nCurrently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p filter=string\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, \n, or \n.\n\n\nFor example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.\n\n\nYou can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.\n\n\nTo filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \nIntel Skylake\n). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = \nIntel Skylake\n) OR (cpuPlatform = \nIntel Broadwell\n) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p page-token=string\n\n\n\n\nSpecifies a page token to use.

Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression \n[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?\n which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last charaicter, which cannot be a dash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnode-affinity-labels=key=clita\n\n\nLabels to use for node affinity, which will be used in instance scheduling.\n\n\nthe value will be associated with the given \nkey\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnode-type=justo\n\n\nThe node type to use for nodes group that are created from this template.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnode-type-flexibility    cpus=sadipscing\n\n\nNo description provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlocal-ssd=lorem\n\n\nNo description provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmemory=eirmod\n\n\n\n\nNo description provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    region=diam\n\n\n\n\n[Output Only] The name of the region where the node template resides, such as us-central1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nself-link=est\n\n\n[Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstatus=vero\n\n\n[Output Only] The status of the node template.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nProjectsDisableXpnResourceRequest:\n  xpn-resource:\n    id: string\n    type: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .xpn-resource    id=voluptua.\n\n\nThe ID of the service resource. In the case of projects, this field matches the project ID (e.g., my-project), not the project number (e.g., 12345678).\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntype=rebum.\n\n\nThe type of the service resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nProjectsListXpnHostsRequest:\n  organization: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order.

If not specified, the organization will be inferred from the project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform =  Intel Skylake ). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform =  Intel Skylake ) OR (cpuPlatform =  Intel Broadwell ) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).      -p order-by=string    Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy= creationTimestamp desc .

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that \n-p\n is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this \n-p k1=v1 k2=v2\n even though the listing below repeats the\n\n-p\n for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n-p request-id=string\n\n\n\n\nAn optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.\n\n\nFor example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.\n\n\nThe request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.    -r .autoscaling-policy    cool-down-period-sec=95    The number of seconds that the autoscaler should wait before it starts collecting information from a new instance. This prevents the autoscaler from collecting information when the instance is initializing, during which the collected usage would not be reliable. The default time autoscaler waits is 60 seconds.  Virtual machine initialization times might vary because of numerous factors. We recommend that you test how long an instance may take to initialize. To do this, create an instance and time the startup process.\n*  cpu-utilization    utilization-target=0.23750221865 \n    - The target CPU utilization that the autoscaler should maintain. Must be a float value in the range (0, 1]. If not specified, the default is 0.6.  If the CPU level is below the target utilization, the autoscaler scales down the number of instances until it reaches the minimum number of instances you specified or until the average CPU of your instances reaches the target utilization.  If the average CPU is above the target utilization, the autoscaler scales up until it reaches the maximum number of instances you specified or until the average utilization reaches the target utilization.      ..load-balancing-utilization    utilization-target=0.819018748328   Fraction of backend capacity utilization (set in HTTP(s) load balancing configuration) that autoscaler should maintain. Must be a positive float value. If not defined, the default is 0.8.     ..    max-num-replicas=98   The maximum number of instances that the autoscaler can scale up to. This is required when creating or updating an autoscaler. The maximum number of replicas should not be lower than minimal number of replicas.     min-num-replicas=12   The minimum number of replicas that the autoscaler can scale down to. This cannot be less than 0. If not provided, autoscaler will choose a default value depending on maximum number of instances allowed.     ..    creation-timestamp=dolor   [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.    description=ea  An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.    id=elitr  [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.    kind=voluptua.  [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#autoscaler for autoscalers.    name=et  Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created.

[Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.    status=justo  [Output Only] The status of the autoscaler configuration.    target=et  URL of the managed instance group that this autoscaler will scale.    zone=rebum.

Default is 30 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly.

Please note that \n-p\n is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this \n-p k1=v1 k2=v2\n even though the listing below repeats the\n\n-p\n for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n-p request-id=string\n\n\n\n\nAn optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.\n\n\nFor example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.\n\n\nThe request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nBackendService:\n  affinity-cookie-ttl-sec: integer\n  cdn-policy:\n    cache-key-policy:\n      include-host: boolean\n      include-protocol: boolean\n      include-query-string: boolean\n      query-string-blacklist: [string]\n      query-string-whitelist: [string]\n    signed-url-cache-max-age-sec: string\n    signed-url-key-names: [string]\n  connection-draining:\n    draining-timeout-sec: integer\n  creation-timestamp: string\n  description: string\n  enable-cdn: boolean\n  fingerprint: string\n  health-checks: [string]\n  iap:\n    enabled: boolean\n    oauth2-client-id: string\n    oauth2-client-secret: string\n    oauth2-client-secret-sha256: string\n  id: string\n  kind: string\n  load-balancing-scheme: string\n  name: string\n  port: integer\n  port-name: string\n  protocol: string\n  region: string\n  security-policy: string\n  self-link: string\n  session-affinity: string\n  timeout-sec: integer\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order.

If set to 0, the cookie is non-persistent and lasts only until the end of the browser session (or equivalent). The maximum allowed value for TTL is one day.\n\n\nWhen the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, this field is not used.\n\n \ncdn-policy.cache-key-policy    include-host=true\n\n    - If true, requests to different hosts will be cached separately.\n\n \ninclude-protocol=false\n\n    - If true, http and https requests will be cached separately.\n\n \ninclude-query-string=false\n\n    - If true, include query string parameters in the cache key according to query_string_whitelist and query_string_blacklist. If neither is set, the entire query string will be included. If false, the query string will be excluded from the cache key entirely.\n\n \nquery-string-blacklist=vero\n\n    - Names of query string parameters to exclude in cache keys.

After this time period, the response will be revalidated before being served. Defaults to 1hr (3600s). When serving responses to signed URL requests, Cloud CDN will internally behave as though all responses from this backend had a ?Cache-Control: public, max-age=[TTL]? header, regardless of any existing Cache-Control header.

A hash of the contents stored in this object. This field is used in optimistic locking. This field will be ignored when inserting a BackendService. An up-to-date fingerprint must be provided in order to update the BackendService.\n\n\nTo see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve a BackendService.\n* \nhealth-checks=nonumy\n\n    - The list of URLs to the HttpHealthCheck or HttpsHealthCheck resource for health checking this BackendService. Currently at most one health check can be specified, and a health check is required for Compute Engine backend services. A health check must not be specified for App Engine backend and Cloud Function backend.\n\n\nFor internal load balancing, a URL to a HealthCheck resource must be specified instead.\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n \niap    enabled=true\n\n    - No description provided.\n\n \noauth2-client-id=gubergren\n\n    - No description provided.\n\n \noauth2-client-secret=ipsum\n\n    - No description provided.\n\n \noauth2-client-secret-sha256=kasd\n\n    - [Output Only] SHA256 hash value for the field oauth2_client_secret above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    id=eos\n\n\n\n\n[Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource.

A backend service created for one type of load balancing cannot be used with the other. Possible values are INTERNAL and EXTERNAL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname=at\n\n\nName of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression \n[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?\n which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nport=68\n\n\n\n\nDeprecated in favor of portName. The TCP port to connect on the backend. The default value is 80.\n\n\nThis cannot be used for internal load balancing.\n* \nport-name=amet\n\n    - Name of backend port. The same name should appear in the instance groups referenced by this service. Required when the load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL.\n\n\nWhen the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, this field is not used.\n* \nprotocol=rebum.\n\n    - The protocol this BackendService uses to communicate with backends.\n\n\nPossible values are HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and SSL. The default is HTTP.\n\n\nFor internal load balancing, the possible values are TCP and UDP, and the default is TCP.\n\n \nregion=sed\n\n    - [Output Only] URL of the region where the regional backend service resides. This field is not applicable to global backend services. You must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is not settable as a field in the request body.\n\n \nsecurity-policy=dolore\n\n    - [Output Only] The resource URL for the security policy associated with this backend service.\n\n \nself-link=est\n\n    - [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.\n\n \nsession-affinity=invidunt\n\n    - Type of session affinity to use. The default is NONE.\n\n\nWhen the load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL, can be NONE, CLIENT_IP, or GENERATED_COOKIE.\n\n\nWhen the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, can be NONE, CLIENT_IP, CLIENT_IP_PROTO, or CLIENT_IP_PORT_PROTO.\n\n\nWhen the protocol is UDP, this field is not used.\n* \ntimeout-sec=91\n\n    - How many seconds to wait for the backend before considering it a failed request. Default is 30 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that \n-p\n is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this \n-p k1=v1 k2=v2\n even though the listing below repeats the\n\n-p\n for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n-p request-id=string\n\n\n\n\nAn optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.\n\n\nFor example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.\n\n\nThe request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call.

Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.\n\n\nFor example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.\n\n\nThe request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level.

Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.\n\n\nFor example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.\n\n\nThe request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

You can specify this field when creating a persistent disk using the sourceImage or sourceSnapshot parameter, or specify it alone to create an empty persistent disk.  If you specify this field along with sourceImage or sourceSnapshot, the value of sizeGb must not be less than the size of the sourceImage or the size of the snapshot. Acceptable values are 1 to 65536, inclusive.\n*  source-image=et \n    - The source image used to create this disk. If the source image is deleted, this field will not be set.  To create a disk with one of the public operating system images, specify the image by its family name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy= creationTimestamp desc . This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.      -p page-token=string   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.     -p filter=string    A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=,  , or  .  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform =  Intel Skylake ). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform =  Intel Skylake ) OR (cpuPlatform =  Intel Broadwell ) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).",

The value must be 1-58 characters long. Instances are named by appending a hyphen and a random four-character string to the base instance name. The base instance name must comply with RFC1035.    creation-timestamp=dolor  [Output Only] The creation timestamp for this managed instance group in RFC3339 text format.    current-actions    abandoning=12  [Output Only] The total number of instances in the managed instance group that are scheduled to be abandoned. Abandoning an instance removes it from the managed instance group without deleting it.     creating=6    [Output Only] The number of instances in the managed instance group that are scheduled to be created or are currently being created.

If you have disabled creation retries, this field will not be populated; instead, the creatingWithoutRetries field will be populated.   creating-without-retries=44 \n    - [Output Only] The number of instances that the managed instance group will attempt to create. The group attempts to create each instance only once. If the group fails to create any of these instances, it decreases the group s targetSize value accordingly.   deleting=50 \n    - [Output Only] The number of instances in the managed instance group that are scheduled to be deleted or are currently being deleted.   none=85 \n    - [Output Only] The number of instances in the managed instance group that are running and have no scheduled actions.   recreating=85 \n    - [Output Only] The number of instances in the managed instance group that are scheduled to be recreated or are currently being being recreated. Recreating an instance deletes the existing root persistent disk and creates a new disk from the image that is defined in the instance template.   refreshing=1 \n    - [Output Only] The number of instances in the managed instance group that are being reconfigured with properties that do not require a restart or a recreate action. For example, setting or removing target pools for the instance.   restarting=26 \n    - [Output Only] The number of instances in the managed instance group that are scheduled to be restarted or are currently being restarted.      ..    description=ut   An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.    fingerprint=dolores   Fingerprint of this resource. This field may be used in optimistic locking. It will be ignored when inserting an InstanceGroupManager. An up-to-date fingerprint must be provided in order to update the InstanceGroupManager.  To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve an InstanceGroupManager.   id=sanctus \n    - [Output Only] A unique identifier for this resource type. The server generates this identifier.   instance-group=et \n    - [Output Only] The URL of the Instance Group resource.   instance-template=elitr \n    - The URL of the instance template that is specified for this managed instance group. The group uses this template to create all new instances in the managed instance group.   kind=erat \n    - [Output Only] The resource type, which is always compute#instanceGroupManager for managed instance groups.   name=sadipscing \n    - The name of the managed instance group. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.   region=tempor \n    - [Output Only] The URL of the region where the managed instance group resides (for regional resources).   self-link=sadipscing \n    - [Output Only] The URL for this managed instance group. The server defines this URL.   target-pools=amet \n    - The URLs for all TargetPool resources to which instances in the instanceGroup field are added. The target pools automatically apply to all of the instances in the managed instance group.\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.   target-size=44 \n    - The target number of running instances for this managed instance group. Deleting or abandoning instances reduces this number. Resizing the group changes this number.   zone=vero \n    - [Output Only] The URL of the zone where the managed instance group is located (for zonal resources).",

Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.     -p filter=string    A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=,  , or  .  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform =  Intel Skylake ). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform =  Intel Skylake ) OR (cpuPlatform =  Intel Broadwell ) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).      -p max-results=integer   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)     -p order-by=string    Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy= creationTimestamp desc . This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.",

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform =  Intel Skylake ). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform =  Intel Skylake ) OR (cpuPlatform =  Intel Broadwell ) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).",

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nRouter:\n  bgp:\n    advertise-mode: string\n    advertised-groups: [string]\n    asn: integer\n  creation-timestamp: string\n  description: string\n  id: string\n  kind: string\n  name: string\n  network: string\n  region: string\n  self-link: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .bgp    advertise-mode=sit\n\n\nUser-specified flag to indicate which mode to use for advertisement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadvertised-groups=diam\n\n\nUser-specified list of prefix groups to advertise in custom mode. This field can only be populated if advertise_mode is CUSTOM and is advertised to all peers of the router. These groups will be advertised in addition to any specified prefixes. Leave this field blank to advertise no custom groups.\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nasn=97\n\n\n\n\nLocal BGP Autonomous System Number (ASN). Must be an RFC6996 private ASN, either 16-bit or 32-bit. The value will be fixed for this router resource. All VPN tunnels that link to this router will have the same local ASN.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    creation-timestamp=sadipscing\n\n\n\n\n[Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndescription=erat\n\n\nAn optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid=rebum.\n\n\n[Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkind=ipsum\n\n\n[Output Only] Type of resource. Always compute#router for routers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname=at\n\n\nName of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression \n[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?\n which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnetwork=elitr\n\n\nURI of the network to which this router belongs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nregion=no\n\n\n[Output Only] URI of the region where the router resides. You must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is not settable as a field in the request body.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nself-link=kasd\n\n\n[Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call.

Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.\n\n\nFor example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.\n\n\nThe request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nSecurityPolicy:\n  creation-timestamp: string\n  description: string\n  fingerprint: string\n  id: string\n  kind: string\n  name: string\n  self-link: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .    creation-timestamp=gubergren\n\n\n[Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndescription=erat\n\n\nAn optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfingerprint=aliquyam\n\n\n\n\nSpecifies a fingerprint for this resource, which is essentially a hash of the metadata\ns contents and used for optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update metadata. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change metadata.\n\n\nTo see the latest fingerprint, make get() request to the security policy.\n\n \nid=voluptua.\n\n    - [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.\n\n \nkind=ipsum\n\n    - [Output only] Type of the resource. Always compute#securityPolicyfor security policies\n\n \nname=labore\n\n    - Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression \n[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?\n which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.\n\n \nself-link=ea\n\n    - [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call.

Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.\n\n\nFor example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.\n\n\nThe request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level.

For example, (cpuPlatform =  Intel Skylake ) OR (cpuPlatform =  Intel Broadwell ) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).      -p max-results=integer   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)     -p page-token=string   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.     -p order-by=string    Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy= creationTimestamp desc . This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.",

Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression  [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?  which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.    quic-override=dolore  Specifies the QUIC override policy for this TargetHttpsProxy resource. This determines whether the load balancer will attempt to negotiate QUIC with clients or not. Can specify one of NONE, ENABLE, or DISABLE. Specify ENABLE to always enable QUIC, Enables QUIC when set to ENABLE, and disables QUIC when set to DISABLE. If NONE is specified, uses the QUIC policy with no user overrides, which is equivalent to DISABLE. Not specifying this field is equivalent to specifying NONE.    self-link=dolores  [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.    ssl-certificates=et  URLs to SslCertificate resources that are used to authenticate connections between users and the load balancer. Currently, exactly one SSL certificate must be specified.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    ssl-policy=no  URL of SslPolicy resource that will be associated with the TargetHttpsProxy resource. If not set, the TargetHttpsProxy resource will not have any SSL policy configured.    url-map=ipsum  A fully-qualified or valid partial URL to the UrlMap resource that defines the mapping from URL to the BackendService. For example, the following are all valid URLs for specifying a URL map:    https://www.googleapis.compute/v1/projects/project/global/urlMaps/url-map   projects/project/global/urlMaps/url-map   global/urlMaps/url-map",

For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.\n\n\nTo filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \nIntel Skylake\n). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform =  Intel Skylake ). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform =  Intel Skylake ) OR (cpuPlatform =  Intel Broadwell ) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).      -p max-results=integer   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)     -p page-token=string   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.     -p order-by=string    Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy= creationTimestamp desc . This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.",

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nTargetPool:\n  backup-pool: string\n  creation-timestamp: string\n  description: string\n  failover-ratio: number\n  health-checks: [string]\n  id: string\n  instances: [string]\n  kind: string\n  name: string\n  region: string\n  self-link: string\n  session-affinity: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .    backup-pool=stet\n\n\n\n\nThis field is applicable only when the containing target pool is serving a forwarding rule as the primary pool, and its failoverRatio field is properly set to a value between [0, 1].\n\n\nbackupPool and failoverRatio together define the fallback behavior of the primary target pool: if the ratio of the healthy instances in the primary pool is at or below failoverRatio, traffic arriving at the load-balanced IP will be directed to the backup pool.\n\n\nIn case where failoverRatio and backupPool are not set, or all the instances in the backup pool are unhealthy, the traffic will be directed back to the primary pool in the \nforce\n mode, where traffic will be spread to the healthy instances with the best effort, or to all instances when no instance is healthy.\n\n \ncreation-timestamp=clita\n\n    - [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.\n\n \ndescription=est\n\n    - An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.\n* \nfailover-ratio=0.699405581978\n\n    - This field is applicable only when the containing target pool is serving a forwarding rule as the primary pool (i.e., not as a backup pool to some other target pool). The value of the field must be in [0, 1].\n\n\nIf set, backupPool must also be set. They together define the fallback behavior of the primary target pool: if the ratio of the healthy instances in the primary pool is at or below this number, traffic arriving at the load-balanced IP will be directed to the backup pool.\n\n\nIn case where failoverRatio is not set or all the instances in the backup pool are unhealthy, the traffic will be directed back to the primary pool in the \nforce\n mode, where traffic will be spread to the healthy instances with the best effort, or to all instances when no instance is healthy.\n\n \nhealth-checks=labore\n\n    - The URL of the HttpHealthCheck resource. A member instance in this pool is considered healthy if and only if the health checks pass. An empty list means all member instances will be considered healthy at all times. Only HttpHealthChecks are supported. Only one health check may be specified.\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n \nid=diam\n\n    - [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.\n\n \ninstances=est\n\n    - A list of resource URLs to the virtual machine instances serving this pool. They must live in zones contained in the same region as this pool.\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n \nkind=labore\n\n    - [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#targetPool for target pools.\n\n \nname=rebum.\n\n    - Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression \n[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?\n which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.\n\n \nregion=stet\n\n    - [Output Only] URL of the region where the target pool resides.\n\n \nself-link=dolor\n\n    - [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.\n\n \nsession-affinity=erat\n\n    - Sesssion affinity option, must be one of the following values:\nNONE: Connections from the same client IP may go to any instance in the pool.\nCLIENT_IP: Connections from the same client IP will go to the same instance in the pool while that instance remains healthy.\nCLIENT_IP_PROTO: Connections from the same client IP with the same IP protocol will go to the same instance in the pool while that instance remains healthy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that \n-p\n is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this \n-p k1=v1 k2=v2\n even though the listing below repeats the\n\n-p\n for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n-p request-id=string\n\n\n\n\nAn optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.\n\n\nFor example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.\n\n\nThe request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=,  , or  .  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform =  Intel Skylake ). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform =  Intel Skylake ) OR (cpuPlatform =  Intel Broadwell ) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).      -p max-results=integer   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)",

This field is used in optimistic locking. This field will be ignored when inserting a UrlMap.

Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression \n[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?\n which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.\n\n \nself-link=magna\n\n    - [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call.

Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.     -p filter=string    A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=,  , or  .  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform =  Intel Skylake ). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform =  Intel Skylake ) OR (cpuPlatform =  Intel Broadwell ) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).      -p order-by=string    Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy= creationTimestamp desc .

Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.      -p max-results=integer   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.

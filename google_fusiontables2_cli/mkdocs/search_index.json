You can change the directory used to store configuration with the \n--config-dir\n flag on a per-invocation basis.\n\n\nMore information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMost APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the \nscope\n determines the \nset of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/fusiontables2-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/fusiontables2-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \nfusiontables\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \nfusiontables2 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.   -r .base-column    column-id=46  The id of the column in the base table from which this column is derived.     table-index=96   Offset to the entry in the list of base tables in the table definition.     ..    column-id=80   Identifier for the column.    column-json-schema=duo  JSON schema for interpreting JSON in this column.    column-properties-json=aliquyam  JSON object containing custom column properties.    description=sea  Column description.    format-pattern=lorem  Format pattern.\n    Acceptable values are DT_DATE_MEDIUMe.g Dec 24, 2008 DT_DATE_SHORTfor example 12/24/08 DT_DATE_TIME_MEDIUMfor example Dec 24, 2008 8:30:45 PM DT_DATE_TIME_SHORTfor example 12/24/08 8:30 PM DT_DAY_MONTH_2_DIGIT_YEARfor example 24/12/08 DT_DAY_MONTH_2_DIGIT_YEAR_TIMEfor example 24/12/08 20:30 DT_DAY_MONTH_2_DIGIT_YEAR_TIME_MERIDIANfor example 24/12/08 8:30 PM DT_DAY_MONTH_4_DIGIT_YEARfor example 24/12/2008 DT_DAY_MONTH_4_DIGIT_YEAR_TIMEfor example 24/12/2008 20:30 DT_DAY_MONTH_4_DIGIT_YEAR_TIME_MERIDIANfor example 24/12/2008 8:30 PM DT_ISO_YEAR_MONTH_DAYfor example 2008-12-24 DT_ISO_YEAR_MONTH_DAY_TIMEfor example 2008-12-24 20:30:45 DT_MONTH_DAY_4_DIGIT_YEARfor example 12/24/2008 DT_TIME_LONGfor example 8:30:45 PM UTC-6 DT_TIME_MEDIUMfor example 8:30:45 PM DT_TIME_SHORTfor example 8:30 PM DT_YEAR_ONLYfor example 2008 HIGHLIGHT_UNTYPED_CELLSHighlight cell data that does not match the data type NONENo formatting (default) NUMBER_CURRENCYfor example $1234.56 NUMBER_DEFAULTfor example 1,234.56 NUMBER_INTEGERfor example 1235 NUMBER_NO_SEPARATORfor example 1234.56 NUMBER_PERCENTfor example 123,456% NUMBER_SCIENTIFICfor example 1E3 STRING_EIGHT_LINE_IMAGEDisplays thumbnail images as tall as eight lines of text STRING_FOUR_LINE_IMAGEDisplays thumbnail images as tall as four lines of text STRING_JSON_TEXTAllows editing of text as JSON in UI STRING_JSON_LISTAllows editing of text as a JSON list in UI STRING_LINKTreats cell as a link (must start with http:// or https://) STRING_ONE_LINE_IMAGEDisplays thumbnail images as tall as one line of text STRING_VIDEO_OR_MAPDisplay a video or map thumbnail    graph-predicate=eos  Column graph predicate.\n    Used to map table to graph data model (subject,predicate,object)\n    See W3C Graph-based Data Model.    kind=erat  The kind of item this is.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nTable:\n  attribution: string\n  attribution-link: string\n  base-table-ids: [string]\n  column-properties-json-schema: string\n  description: string\n  is-exportable: boolean\n  kind: string\n  name: string\n  sql: string\n  table-id: string\n  table-properties-json: string\n  table-properties-json-schema: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .    attribution=at\n\n\nAttribution assigned to the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nattribution-link=consetetur\n\n\nOptional link for attribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbase-table-ids=et\n\n\nBase table identifier if this table is a view or merged table.\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncolumn-properties-json-schema=sed\n\n\nDefault JSON schema for validating all JSON column properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndescription=sit\n\n\nDescription assigned to the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nis-exportable=true\n\n\nVariable for whether table is exportable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkind=elitr\n\n\nThe kind of item this is. For a table, this is always fusiontables#table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname=nonumy\n\n\nName assigned to a table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsql=rebum.\n\n\nSQL that encodes the table definition for derived tables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntable-id=lorem\n\n\nEncrypted unique alphanumeric identifier for the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntable-properties-json=lorem\n\n\nJSON object containing custom table properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntable-properties-json-schema=diam\n\n\nJSON schema for validating the JSON table properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nTemplate:\n  automatic-column-names: [string]\n  body: string\n  kind: string\n  name: string\n  table-id: string\n  template-id: integer\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .    automatic-column-names=et\n\n\nList of columns from which the template is to be automatically constructed. Only one of body or automaticColumns can be specified.\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbody=nonumy\n\n\nBody of the template. It contains HTML with {column_name} to insert values from a particular column. The body is sanitized to remove certain tags, e.g., script. Only one of body or automaticColumns can be specified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkind=et\n\n\nThe kind of item this is. For a template, this is always fusiontables#template.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname=sed\n\n\nOptional name assigned to a template.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntable-id=no\n\n\nIdentifier for the table for which the template is defined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntemplate-id=63\n\n\nIdentifier for the template, unique within the context of a particular table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

For example, a structure like this:  Template:\n  automatic-column-names: [string]\n  body: string\n  kind: string\n  name: string\n  table-id: string\n  template-id: integer  can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order.

Only one of body or automaticColumns can be specified.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    body=at  Body of the template. It contains HTML with {column_name} to insert values from a particular column. The body is sanitized to remove certain tags, e.g., script.

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. .

You can change the directory used to store configuration with the \n--config-dir\n flag on a per-invocation basis.\n\n\nMore information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMost APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the \nscope\n determines the \nset of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/ml1-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/ml1-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \nml\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \nml1 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nGoogleCloudMlV1__CancelJobRequest:\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nGoogleIamV1__SetIamPolicyRequest:\n  policy:\n    etag: string\n    iam-owned: boolean\n    version: integer\n  update-mask: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-r .policy    etag=ea\n\n\n\n\n\n\netag\n is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help\n    prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other.\n    It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the \netag\n in the\n    read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race\n    conditions: An \netag\n is returned in the response to \ngetIamPolicy\n, and\n    systems are expected to put that etag in the request to \nsetIamPolicy\n to\n    ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.\n\n\nIf no \netag\n is provided in the call to \nsetIamPolicy\n, then the existing\npolicy is overwritten blindly.\n\n \niam-owned=false\n\n    - No description provided.\n\n \nversion=98\n\n    - Version of the \nPolicy\n. The default version is 0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    update-mask=dolor\n\n\n\n\nOPTIONAL: A FieldMask specifying which fields of the policy to modify. Only\n    the fields in the mask will be modified. If no mask is provided, the\n    following default mask is used:\n    paths: \nbindings, etag\n\n    This field is only used by Cloud IAM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p bearer-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth bearer token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.  For example, a structure like this:  GoogleCloudMlV1__Version:\n  auto-scaling:\n    min-nodes: integer\n  create-time: string\n  deployment-uri: string\n  description: string\n  error-message: string\n  is-default: boolean\n  last-use-time: string\n  manual-scaling:\n    nodes: integer\n  name: string\n  runtime-version: string\n  state: string  can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.    -r .auto-scaling    min-nodes=78    Optional. The minimum number of nodes to allocate for this model. These\n    nodes are always up, starting from the time the model is deployed, so the\n    cost of operating this model will be at least\n     rate  *  min_nodes  * number of hours since last billing cycle,\n    where  rate  is the cost per node-hour as documented in\n     pricing ,\n    even if no predictions are performed. There is additional cost for each\n    prediction performed.  Unlike manual scaling, if the load gets too heavy for the nodes\nthat are up, the service will automatically add nodes to handle the\nincreased load as well as scale back as traffic drops, always maintaining\nat least  min_nodes . You will be charged for the time in which additional\nnodes are used.  If not specified,  min_nodes  defaults to 0, in which case, when traffic\nto a model stops (and after a cool-down period), nodes will be shut down\nand no charges will be incurred until traffic to the model resumes.      ..    create-time=consetetur   Output only.

The description specified for the version when it was created.   error-message=lorem \n    - Output only. The details of a failure or a cancellation.\n*  is-default=true \n    - Output only. If true, this version will be used to handle prediction\nrequests that do not specify a version.  You can change the default version by calling projects.methods.versions.setDefault .   last-use-time=justo \n    - Output only. The time the version was last used for prediction.   manual-scaling    nodes=49 \n    - The number of nodes to allocate for this model. These nodes are always up,\nstarting from the time the model is deployed, so the cost of operating\nthis model will be proportional to  nodes  * number of hours since\nlast billing cycle plus the cost for each prediction performed.      ..    name=vero    Required.The name specified for the version when it was created.  The version name must be unique within the model it is created in.   runtime-version=diam \n    - Optional.

You can change the directory used to store configuration with the \n--config-dir\n flag on a per-invocation basis.\n\n\nMore information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMost APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the \nscope\n determines the \nset of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/appengine1-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/appengine1-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \nappengine\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \nappengine1 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

Name of the parent Application resource. Example: apps/myapp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired Request Value\n\n\nThe request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nAuthorizedCertificate:\n  certificate-raw-data:\n    private-key: string\n    public-certificate: string\n  display-name: string\n  domain-mappings-count: integer\n  domain-names: [string]\n  expire-time: string\n  id: string\n  name: string\n  visible-domain-mappings: [string]\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .certificate-raw-data    private-key=eirmod\n\n\nUnencrypted PEM encoded RSA private key. This field is set once on certificate creation and then encrypted. The key size must be 2048 bits or fewer. Must include the header and footer. Example: \npre\n -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- \nunencrypted_key_value\n -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY----- \n/pre\n @InputOnly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npublic-certificate=sit\n\n\n\n\nPEM encoded x.509 public key certificate. This field is set once on certificate creation. Must include the header and footer. Example: \npre\n -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- \ncertificate_value\n -----END CERTIFICATE----- \n/pre\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    display-name=stet\n\n\n\n\nThe user-specified display name of the certificate. This is not guaranteed to be unique. Example: My Certificate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndomain-mappings-count=59\n\n\nAggregate count of the domain mappings with this certificate mapped. This count includes domain mappings on applications for which the user does not have VIEWER permissions.Only returned by GET or LIST requests when specifically requested by the view=FULL_CERTIFICATE option.@OutputOnly\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndomain-names=et\n\n\nTopmost applicable domains of this certificate. This certificate applies to these domains and their subdomains. Example: example.com.@OutputOnly\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexpire-time=dolores\n\n\nThe time when this certificate expires. To update the renewal time on this certificate, upload an SSL certificate with a different expiration time using AuthorizedCertificates.UpdateAuthorizedCertificate.@OutputOnly\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid=kasd\n\n\nRelative name of the certificate. This is a unique value autogenerated on AuthorizedCertificate resource creation. Example: 12345.@OutputOnly\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname=accusam\n\n\nFull path to the AuthorizedCertificate resource in the API. Example: apps/myapp/authorizedCertificates/12345.@OutputOnly\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvisible-domain-mappings=takimata\n\n\nThe full paths to user visible Domain Mapping resources that have this certificate mapped. Example: apps/myapp/domainMappings/example.com.This may not represent the full list of mapped domain mappings if the user does not have VIEWER permissions on all of the applications that have this certificate mapped.

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nAuthorizedCertificate:\n  certificate-raw-data:\n    private-key: string\n    public-certificate: string\n  display-name: string\n  domain-mappings-count: integer\n  domain-names: [string]\n  expire-time: string\n  id: string\n  name: string\n  visible-domain-mappings: [string]\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order.

This field is set once on certificate creation and then encrypted. The key size must be 2048 bits or fewer. Must include the header and footer. Example: \npre\n -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- \nunencrypted_key_value\n -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY----- \n/pre\n @InputOnly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npublic-certificate=amet.\n\n\n\n\nPEM encoded x.509 public key certificate.

Example: \npre\n -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- \ncertificate_value\n -----END CERTIFICATE----- \n/pre\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    display-name=erat\n\n\n\n\nThe user-specified display name of the certificate.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call.

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.  For example, a structure like this:  FirewallRule:\n  action: string\n  description: string\n  priority: integer\n  source-range: string  can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.   -r .    action=amet  The action to take on matched requests.    description=no  An optional string description of this rule. This field has a maximum length of 100 characters.    priority=65  A positive integer between 1, Int32.MaxValue-1 that defines the order of rule evaluation. Rules with the lowest priority are evaluated first.A default rule at priority Int32.MaxValue matches all IPv4 and IPv6 traffic when no previous rule matches. Only the action of this rule can be modified by the user.    source-range=eirmod  IP address or range, defined using CIDR notation, of requests that this rule applies to. You can use the wildcard character  *  to match all IPs equivalent to  0/0  and  ::/0  together. Examples: 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.0/16 or 2001:db8::/32  or 2001:0db8:0000:0042:0000:8a2e:0370:7334. p Truncation will be silently performed on addresses which are not properly truncated. For example, 1.2.3.4/24 is accepted as the same address as 1.2.3.0/24. Similarly, for IPv6, 2001:db8::1/32 is accepted as the same address as 2001:db8::/32.",

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly.

See documentation of \nappsId\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired Request Value\n\n\nThe request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nFirewallRule:\n  action: string\n  description: string\n  priority: integer\n  source-range: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .    action=dolore\n\n\nThe action to take on matched requests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndescription=invidunt\n\n\nAn optional string description of this rule. This field has a maximum length of 100 characters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npriority=19\n\n\nA positive integer between 1, Int32.MaxValue-1 that defines the order of rule evaluation. Rules with the lowest priority are evaluated first.A default rule at priority Int32.MaxValue matches all IPv4 and IPv6 traffic when no previous rule matches. Only the action of this rule can be modified by the user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsource-range=accusam\n\n\nIP address or range, defined using CIDR notation, of requests that this rule applies to. You can use the wildcard character \n*\n to match all IPs equivalent to \n0/0\n and \n::/0\n together. Examples: 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.0/16 or 2001:db8::/32  or 2001:0db8:0000:0042:0000:8a2e:0370:7334.\np\nTruncation will be silently performed on addresses which are not properly truncated. For example, 1.2.3.4/24 is accepted as the same address as 1.2.3.0/24. Similarly, for IPv6, 2001:db8::1/32 is accepted as the same address as 2001:db8::/32.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call.

See documentation of \nappsId\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired Request Value\n\n\nThe request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nService:\n  id: string\n  name: string\n  split:\n    allocations: { string: number }\n    shard-by: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .    id=dolor\n\n\nRelative name of the service within the application. Example: default.@OutputOnly\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname=dolor\n\n\nFull path to the Service resource in the API. Example: apps/myapp/services/default.@OutputOnly\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsplit    allocations=key=0.775321302285\n\n\nMapping from version IDs within the service to fractional (0.000, 1] allocations of traffic for that version. Each version can be specified only once, but some versions in the service may not have any traffic allocation. Services that have traffic allocated cannot be deleted until either the service is deleted or their traffic allocation is removed. Allocations must sum to 1. Up to two decimal place precision is supported for IP-based splits and up to three decimal places is supported for cookie-based splits.\n\n\nthe value will be associated with the given \nkey\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshard-by=consetetur\n\n\nMechanism used to determine which version a request is sent to. The traffic selection algorithm will be stable for either type until allocations are changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n.

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p bearer-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth bearer token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call.

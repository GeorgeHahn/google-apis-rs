You can change the directory used to store configuration with the \n--config-dir\n flag on a per-invocation basis.\n\n\nMore information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMost APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the \nscope\n determines the \nset of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/drive2-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/drive2-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \ndrive\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \ndrive2 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that \n-p\n is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this \n-p k1=v1 k2=v2\n even though the listing below repeats the\n\n-p\n for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p visibility=string\n\n\n\n\nThe visibility of the new file. This parameter is only relevant when the source is not a native Google Doc and convert=false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p timed-text-language=string\n\n\n\n\nThe language of the timed text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p ocr=boolean\n\n\n\n\nWhether to attempt OCR on .jpg, .png, .gif, or .pdf uploads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p pinned=boolean\n\n\n\n\nWhether to pin the head revision of the new copy. A file can have a maximum of 200 pinned revisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p timed-text-track-name=string\n\n\n\n\nThe timed text track name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p convert=boolean\n\n\n\n\nWhether to convert this file to the corresponding Google Docs format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p ocr-language=string\n\n\n\n\nIf ocr is true, hints at the language to use. Valid values are BCP 47 codes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p oauth-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth 2.0 token for the current user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p pretty-print=boolean\n\n\n\n\nReturns response with indentations and line breaks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p quota-user=string\n\n\n\n\nAvailable to use for quota purposes for server-side applications.

About Cursors  The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures.

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. . Each additional  .  moves it up one additional level. E.g.  ...  would go three levels up.",

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nRequired Upload Flags\n\n\nThis method supports the upload of data, which \nrequires\n all of the following flags to be set:\n\n\n\n\n-u (simple|resumable)\n\n\nsimple\n - Upload media all at once.\n\n\nresumable\n - Upload media in a resumable fashion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-f file\n\n\nPath to file to upload.

About Cursors  The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures.

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. . Each additional  .  moves it up one additional level. E.g.  ...  would go three levels up.",

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call.

About Cursors  The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures.

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. . Each additional  .  moves it up one additional level. E.g.  ...  would go three levels up.",

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nRequired Upload Flags\n\n\nThis method supports the upload of data, which \nrequires\n all of the following flags to be set:\n\n\n\n\n-u (simple|resumable)\n\n\nsimple\n - Upload media all at once.\n\n\nresumable\n - Upload media in a resumable fashion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-f file\n\n\nPath to file to upload. It must be seekable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following flag \nmay\n be set: \n\n\n\n\n-m mime\n\n\nthe mime type, like 'application/octet-stream', which is the default\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that \n-p\n is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this \n-p k1=v1 k2=v2\n even though the listing below repeats the\n\n-p\n for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p remove-parents=string\n\n\n\n\nComma-separated list of parent IDs to remove.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p ocr=boolean\n\n\n\n\nWhether to attempt OCR on .jpg, .png, .gif, or .pdf uploads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p timed-text-language=string\n\n\n\n\nThe language of the timed text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p timed-text-track-name=string\n\n\n\n\nThe timed text track name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p modified-date-behavior=string\n\n\n\n\nDetermines the behavior in which modifiedDate is updated.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nCommentReply:\n  author:\n    display-name: string\n    email-address: string\n    is-authenticated-user: boolean\n    kind: string\n    permission-id: string\n    picture:\n      url: string\n  content: string\n  created-date: string\n  deleted: boolean\n  html-content: string\n  kind: string\n  modified-date: string\n  reply-id: string\n  verb: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .author    display-name=ut\n\n\nA plain text displayable name for this user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nemail-address=duo\n\n\nThe email address of the user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nis-authenticated-user=false\n\n\nWhether this user is the same as the authenticated user for whom the request was made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkind=est\n\n\nThis is always drive#user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npermission-id=et\n\n\nThe user\ns ID as visible in the permissions collection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npicture    url=et\n\n\n\n\nA URL that points to a profile picture of this user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...    content=clita\n\n\n\n\nThe plain text content used to create this reply. This is not HTML safe and should only be used as a starting point to make edits to a reply\ns content. This field is required on inserts if no verb is specified (resolve/reopen).\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncreated-date=consetetur\n\n\nThe date when this reply was first created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndeleted=false\n\n\nWhether this reply has been deleted. If a reply has been deleted the content will be cleared and this will only represent a reply that once existed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhtml-content=invidunt\n\n\nHTML formatted content for this reply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkind=at\n\n\nThis is always drive#commentReply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodified-date=rebum.\n\n\nThe date when this reply was last modified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreply-id=sit\n\n\nThe ID of the reply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nverb=ipsum\n\n\nThe action this reply performed to the parent comment. When creating a new reply this is the action to be perform to the parent comment. Possible values are:  \n\n\nresolve\n - To resolve a comment. \n\n\nreopen\n - To reopen (un-resolve) a comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.   -r .    download-url=justo  Short term download URL for the file. This will only be populated on files with content stored in Drive.    etag=dolore  The ETag of the revision.    export-links=key=at  Links for exporting Google Docs to specific formats.  the value will be associated with the given  key    file-size=dolor  The size of the revision in bytes. This will only be populated on files with content stored in Drive.    id=tempor  The ID of the revision.    kind=ipsum  This is always drive#revision.    last-modifying-user    display-name=est  A plain text displayable name for this user.    email-address=et  The email address of the user.    is-authenticated-user=false  Whether this user is the same as the authenticated user for whom the request was made.    kind=sed  This is always drive#user.    permission-id=kasd  The user s ID as visible in the permissions collection.     picture    url=ipsum   A URL that points to a profile picture of this user.     ...    last-modifying-user-name=sadipscing   Name of the last user to modify this revision.    md5-checksum=sea  An MD5 checksum for the content of this revision. This will only be populated on files with content stored in Drive.    mime-type=eos  The MIME type of the revision.    modified-date=dolor  Last time this revision was modified (formatted RFC 3339 timestamp).    original-filename=lorem  The original filename when this revision was created. This will only be populated on files with content stored in Drive.    pinned=false  Whether this revision is pinned to prevent automatic purging. This will only be populated and can only be modified on files with content stored in Drive which are not Google Docs. Revisions can also be pinned when they are created through the drive.files.insert/update/copy by using the pinned query parameter.    publish-auto=false  Whether subsequent revisions will be automatically republished. This is only populated and can only be modified for Google Docs.    published=true  Whether this revision is published. This is only populated and can only be modified for Google Docs.    published-link=nonumy  A link to the published revision.    published-outside-domain=true  Whether this revision is published outside the domain. This is only populated and can only be modified for Google Docs.    self-link=diam  A link back to this revision.     About Cursors  The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:   The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the  .  character. Fields can be nested such as in  -r f.s.o  .  The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. . Each additional  .  moves it up one additional level. E.g.  ...  would go three levels up.",

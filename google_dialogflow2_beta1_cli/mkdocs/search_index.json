Each scope\n            requires the user to grant this application permission to use it.\n            If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method.\n  --config-dir \nfolder\n\n            A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to\n            a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation.\n            [default: ~/.google-service-cli]\n  --debug\n            Output all server communication to standard error. `tx` and `rx` are placed\n            into the same stream.\n  --debug-auth\n            Output all communication related to authentication to standard error. `tx`\n            and `rx` are placed into the same stream.\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nThe program will store all persistent data in the \n~/.google-service-cli\n directory in \nJSON\n files prefixed with \ndialogflow2-beta1-\n.  You can change the directory used to store configuration with the \n--config-dir\n flag on a per-invocation basis.\n\n\nMore information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMost APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the \nscope\n determines the \nset of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/dialogflow2-beta1-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/dialogflow2-beta1-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \ndialogflow\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \ndialogflow2-beta1 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that \n-p\n is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this \n-p k1=v1 k2=v2\n even though the listing below repeats the\n\n-p\n for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n-p update-mask=string\n\n\nOptional.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .    input-audio=eos\n\n\nOptional. The natural language speech audio to be processed. This field\n    should be populated iff \nquery_input\n is set to an input audio config.\n    A single request can contain up to 1 minute of speech audio data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\noutput-audio-config    audio-encoding=erat\n\n\nRequired. Audio encoding of the synthesized audio content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsample-rate-hertz=6\n\n\nOptional. The synthesis sample rate (in hertz) for this audio. If not\n    provided, then the synthesizer will use the default sample rate based on\n    the audio encoding. If this is different from the voice\ns natural sample\n    rate, then the synthesizer will honor this request by converting to the\n    desired sample rate (which might result in worse audio quality).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsynthesize-speech-config    effects-profile-id=dolor\n\n\nOptional. An identifier which selects \naudio effects\n profiles that are\n    applied on (post synthesized) text to speech. Effects are applied on top of\n    each other in the order they are given.\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npitch=0.618673220052\n\n\nOptional. Speaking pitch, in the range [-20.0, 20.0]. 20 means increase 20\n    semitones from the original pitch. -20 means decrease 20 semitones from the\n    original pitch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspeaking-rate=0.577297745448\n\n\nOptional. Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal\n    native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and\n    0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any\n    other values \n 0.25 or \n 4.0 will return an error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvoice    name=amet\n\n\nOptional. The name of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a\n    voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and gender.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nssml-gender=no\n\n\n\n\nOptional. The preferred gender of the voice. If not set, the service will\n    choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and\n    name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement. If a\n    voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer should\n    substitute a voice with a different gender rather than failing the request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    volume-gain-db=0.65292276369\n\n\n\n\nOptional. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the\n    specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of\n    0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB)\n    will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal\n    amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the\n    amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. We strongly recommend not\n    to exceed +10 (dB) as there\ns usually no effective increase in loudness for\n    any value greater than that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...query-input.audio-config    audio-encoding=eirmod\n\n\n\n\nRequired. Audio encoding of the audio content to process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenable-word-info=true\n\n\nOptional. If \ntrue\n, Dialogflow returns SpeechWordInfo in\n    StreamingRecognitionResult with information about the recognized speech\n    words, e.g. start and end time offsets. If false or unspecified, Speech\n    doesn\nt return any word-level information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlanguage-code=invidunt\n\n\nRequired. The language of the supplied audio. Dialogflow does not do\n    translations. See \nLanguage\n    Support\n\n    for a list of the currently supported language codes. Note that queries in\n    the same session do not necessarily need to specify the same language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel=aliquyam\n\n\nOptional. Which Speech model to select for the given request. Select the\n    model best suited to your domain to get best results.

Audio encoding of the synthesized audio content.    sample-rate-hertz=6  Optional. The synthesis sample rate (in hertz) for this audio. If not\n    provided, then the synthesizer will use the default sample rate based on\n    the audio encoding.

An identifier which selects  audio effects  profiles that are\n    applied on (post synthesized) text to speech. Effects are applied on top of\n    each other in the order they are given.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    pitch=0.618673220052  Optional. Speaking pitch, in the range [-20.0, 20.0]. 20 means increase 20\n    semitones from the original pitch. -20 means decrease 20 semitones from the\n    original pitch.    speaking-rate=0.577297745448  Optional. Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal\n    native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and\n    0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any\n    other values   0.25 or   4.0 will return an error.    voice    name=amet  Optional. The name of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a\n    voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and gender.     ssml-gender=no   Optional. The preferred gender of the voice. If not set, the service will\n    choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and\n    name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement. If a\n    voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer should\n    substitute a voice with a different gender rather than failing the request.     ..    volume-gain-db=0.65292276369   Optional.

This field is only permitted for\nEXTRACTIVE_QA and FAQ knowledge types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .    input-audio=clita\n\n\nOptional. The natural language speech audio to be processed. This field\n    should be populated iff \nquery_input\n is set to an input audio config.\n    A single request can contain up to 1 minute of speech audio data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\noutput-audio-config    audio-encoding=diam\n\n\nRequired. Audio encoding of the synthesized audio content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsample-rate-hertz=30\n\n\nOptional. The synthesis sample rate (in hertz) for this audio. If not\n    provided, then the synthesizer will use the default sample rate based on\n    the audio encoding. If this is different from the voice\ns natural sample\n    rate, then the synthesizer will honor this request by converting to the\n    desired sample rate (which might result in worse audio quality).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsynthesize-speech-config    effects-profile-id=est\n\n\nOptional. An identifier which selects \naudio effects\n profiles that are\n    applied on (post synthesized) text to speech. Effects are applied on top of\n    each other in the order they are given.\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npitch=0.379056915385\n\n\nOptional. Speaking pitch, in the range [-20.0, 20.0]. 20 means increase 20\n    semitones from the original pitch. -20 means decrease 20 semitones from the\n    original pitch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspeaking-rate=0.636549512895\n\n\nOptional. Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal\n    native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and\n    0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any\n    other values \n 0.25 or \n 4.0 will return an error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvoice    name=ut\n\n\nOptional. The name of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a\n    voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and gender.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nssml-gender=dolores\n\n\n\n\nOptional. The preferred gender of the voice. If not set, the service will\n    choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and\n    name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement. If a\n    voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer should\n    substitute a voice with a different gender rather than failing the request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    volume-gain-db=0.762594370144\n\n\n\n\nOptional. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the\n    specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of\n    0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB)\n    will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal\n    amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the\n    amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. We strongly recommend not\n    to exceed +10 (dB) as there\ns usually no effective increase in loudness for\n    any value greater than that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...query-input.audio-config    audio-encoding=voluptua.\n\n\n\n\nRequired. Audio encoding of the audio content to process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenable-word-info=true\n\n\nOptional. If \ntrue\n, Dialogflow returns SpeechWordInfo in\n    StreamingRecognitionResult with information about the recognized speech\n    words, e.g. start and end time offsets. If false or unspecified, Speech\n    doesn\nt return any word-level information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlanguage-code=sed\n\n\nRequired. The language of the supplied audio. Dialogflow does not do\n    translations. See \nLanguage\n    Support\n\n    for a list of the currently supported language codes. Note that queries in\n    the same session do not necessarily need to specify the same language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel=aliquyam\n\n\nOptional. Which Speech model to select for the given request. Select the\n    model best suited to your domain to get best results. If a model is not\n    explicitly specified, then we auto-select a model based on the parameters\n    in the InputAudioConfig.\n    If enhanced speech model is enabled for the agent and an enhanced\n    version of the specified model for the language does not exist, then the\n    speech is recognized using the standard version of the specified model.\n    Refer to\n    \nCloud Speech API\n    documentation\n\n    for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel-variant=ea\n\n\nOptional. Which variant of the Speech model to use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nphrase-hints=ea\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional. A list of strings containing words and phrases that the speech\n    recognizer should recognize with higher likelihood.\n\n\nSee \nthe Cloud Speech\ndocumentation\n\nfor more details.\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n* \nsample-rate-hertz=27\n\n    - Required. Sample rate (in Hertz) of the audio content sent in the query.\nRefer to\n\nCloud Speech API\ndocumentation\n for\nmore details.\n* \nsingle-utterance=true\n\n    - Optional. If \nfalse\n (default), recognition does not cease until the\nclient closes the stream.\nIf \ntrue\n, the recognizer will detect a single spoken utterance in input\naudio. Recognition ceases when it detects the audio\ns voice has\nstopped or paused. In this case, once a detected intent is received, the\nclient should close the stream and start a new request with a new stream as\nneeded.\nNote: This setting is relevant only for streaming methods.\nNote: When specified, InputAudioConfig.single_utterance takes precedence\nover StreamingDetectIntentRequest.single_utterance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..event    language-code=diam\n\n\n\n\nRequired. The language of this query. See \nLanguage\n    Support\n\n    for a list of the currently supported language codes. Note that queries in\n    the same session do not necessarily need to specify the same language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname=kasd\n\n\n\n\nRequired. The unique identifier of the event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..text    language-code=invidunt\n\n\n\n\nRequired. The language of this conversational query. See \nLanguage\n    Support\n\n    for a list of the currently supported language codes. Note that queries in\n    the same session do not necessarily need to specify the same language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntext=rebum.\n\n\n\n\nRequired. The UTF-8 encoded natural language text to be processed.\n    Text length must not exceed 256 characters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...query-params.geo-location    latitude=0.504277591267\n\n\n\n\nThe latitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-90.0, +90.0].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlongitude=0.378784903851\n\n\n\n\nThe longitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-180.0, +180.0].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    knowledge-base-names=invidunt\n\n\n\n\nOptional. KnowledgeBases to get alternative results from. If not set, the\n    KnowledgeBases enabled in the agent (through UI) will be used.\n    Format:  \nprojects/\nlt;Project ID\ngt;/knowledgeBases/\nlt;Knowledge Base ID\ngt;\n.\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreset-contexts=false\n\n\nOptional. Specifies whether to delete all contexts in the current session\n    before the new ones are activated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsentiment-analysis-request-config    analyze-query-text-sentiment=false\n\n\n\n\nOptional. Instructs the service to perform sentiment analysis on\n    \nquery_text\n. If not provided, sentiment analysis is not performed on\n    \nquery_text\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    time-zone=consetetur\n\n\n\n\nOptional. The time zone of this conversational query from the\n    \ntime zone database\n, e.g.,\n    America/New_York, Europe/Paris. If not provided, the time zone specified in\n    agent settings is used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

For example, a structure like this:  GoogleCloudDialogflowV2beta1DetectIntentRequest:\n  input-audio: string\n  output-audio-config:\n    audio-encoding: string\n    sample-rate-hertz: integer\n    synthesize-speech-config:\n      effects-profile-id: [string]\n      pitch: number\n      speaking-rate: number\n      voice:\n        name: string\n        ssml-gender: string\n      volume-gain-db: number\n  query-input:\n    audio-config:\n      audio-encoding: string\n      enable-word-info: boolean\n      language-code: string\n      model: string\n      model-variant: string\n      phrase-hints: [string]\n      sample-rate-hertz: integer\n      single-utterance: boolean\n    event:\n      language-code: string\n      name: string\n    text:\n      language-code: string\n      text: string\n  query-params:\n    geo-location:\n      latitude: number\n      longitude: number\n    knowledge-base-names: [string]\n    reset-contexts: boolean\n    sentiment-analysis-request-config:\n      analyze-query-text-sentiment: boolean\n    time-zone: string  can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.   -r .    input-audio=clita  Optional. The natural language speech audio to be processed. This field\n    should be populated iff  query_input  is set to an input audio config.\n    A single request can contain up to 1 minute of speech audio data.    output-audio-config    audio-encoding=diam  Required. Audio encoding of the synthesized audio content.    sample-rate-hertz=30  Optional. The synthesis sample rate (in hertz) for this audio. If not\n    provided, then the synthesizer will use the default sample rate based on\n    the audio encoding. If this is different from the voice s natural sample\n    rate, then the synthesizer will honor this request by converting to the\n    desired sample rate (which might result in worse audio quality).    synthesize-speech-config    effects-profile-id=est  Optional. An identifier which selects  audio effects  profiles that are\n    applied on (post synthesized) text to speech. Effects are applied on top of\n    each other in the order they are given.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    pitch=0.379056915385  Optional. Speaking pitch, in the range [-20.0, 20.0]. 20 means increase 20\n    semitones from the original pitch. -20 means decrease 20 semitones from the\n    original pitch.    speaking-rate=0.636549512895  Optional. Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal\n    native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and\n    0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any\n    other values   0.25 or   4.0 will return an error.    voice    name=ut  Optional. The name of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a\n    voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and gender.     ssml-gender=dolores   Optional. The preferred gender of the voice. If not set, the service will\n    choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and\n    name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement. If a\n    voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer should\n    substitute a voice with a different gender rather than failing the request.     ..    volume-gain-db=0.762594370144   Optional. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the\n    specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of\n    0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB)\n    will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal\n    amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the\n    amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. We strongly recommend not\n    to exceed +10 (dB) as there s usually no effective increase in loudness for\n    any value greater than that.     ...query-input.audio-config    audio-encoding=voluptua.   Required. Audio encoding of the audio content to process.    enable-word-info=true  Optional. If  true , Dialogflow returns SpeechWordInfo in\n    StreamingRecognitionResult with information about the recognized speech\n    words, e.g. start and end time offsets. If false or unspecified, Speech\n    doesn t return any word-level information.    language-code=sed  Required. The language of the supplied audio. Dialogflow does not do\n    translations. See  Language\n    Support \n    for a list of the currently supported language codes. Note that queries in\n    the same session do not necessarily need to specify the same language.    model=aliquyam  Optional. Which Speech model to select for the given request. Select the\n    model best suited to your domain to get best results. If a model is not\n    explicitly specified, then we auto-select a model based on the parameters\n    in the InputAudioConfig.\n    If enhanced speech model is enabled for the agent and an enhanced\n    version of the specified model for the language does not exist, then the\n    speech is recognized using the standard version of the specified model.\n    Refer to\n     Cloud Speech API\n    documentation \n    for more details.    model-variant=ea  Optional. Which variant of the Speech model to use.     phrase-hints=ea    Optional. A list of strings containing words and phrases that the speech\n    recognizer should recognize with higher likelihood.  See  the Cloud Speech\ndocumentation \nfor more details.\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n*  sample-rate-hertz=27 \n    - Required. Sample rate (in Hertz) of the audio content sent in the query.\nRefer to Cloud Speech API\ndocumentation  for\nmore details.\n*  single-utterance=true \n    - Optional. If  false  (default), recognition does not cease until the\nclient closes the stream.\nIf  true , the recognizer will detect a single spoken utterance in input\naudio. Recognition ceases when it detects the audio s voice has\nstopped or paused. In this case, once a detected intent is received, the\nclient should close the stream and start a new request with a new stream as\nneeded.\nNote: This setting is relevant only for streaming methods.\nNote: When specified, InputAudioConfig.single_utterance takes precedence\nover StreamingDetectIntentRequest.single_utterance.      ..event    language-code=diam   Required. The language of this query. See  Language\n    Support \n    for a list of the currently supported language codes. Note that queries in\n    the same session do not necessarily need to specify the same language.     name=kasd   Required. The unique identifier of the event.     ..text    language-code=invidunt   Required. The language of this conversational query. See  Language\n    Support \n    for a list of the currently supported language codes. Note that queries in\n    the same session do not necessarily need to specify the same language.     text=rebum.   Required. The UTF-8 encoded natural language text to be processed.\n    Text length must not exceed 256 characters.     ...query-params.geo-location    latitude=0.504277591267   The latitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-90.0, +90.0].     longitude=0.378784903851   The longitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-180.0, +180.0].     ..    knowledge-base-names=invidunt   Optional. KnowledgeBases to get alternative results from. If not set, the\n    KnowledgeBases enabled in the agent (through UI) will be used.\n    Format:   projects/ lt;Project ID gt;/knowledgeBases/ lt;Knowledge Base ID gt; .  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    reset-contexts=false  Optional. Specifies whether to delete all contexts in the current session\n    before the new ones are activated.     sentiment-analysis-request-config    analyze-query-text-sentiment=false   Optional. Instructs the service to perform sentiment analysis on\n     query_text . If not provided, sentiment analysis is not performed on\n     query_text .     ..    time-zone=consetetur   Optional. The time zone of this conversational query from the\n     time zone database , e.g.,\n    America/New_York, Europe/Paris. If not provided, the time zone specified in\n    agent settings is used.",

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nGoogleCloudDialogflowV2beta1SessionEntityType:\n  entity-override-mode: string\n  name: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .    entity-override-mode=sit\n\n\nRequired.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level.

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

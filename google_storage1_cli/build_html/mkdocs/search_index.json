You can change the directory used to store configuration with the \n--config-dir\n flag on a per-invocation basis.\n\n\nMore information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMost APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the \nscope\n determines the \nset of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/storage1-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/storage1-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \nstorage\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \nstorage1 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

Event-based hold is a way to retain objects indefinitely until an event occurs, signified by the hold\ns release. After being released, such objects will be subject to bucket-level retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false. Objects under event-based hold cannot be deleted, overwritten or archived until the hold is removed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nencryption    default-kms-key-name=elitr\n\n\n\n\nA Cloud KMS key that will be used to encrypt objects inserted into this bucket, if no encryption method is specified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    etag=amet\n\n\n\n\nHTTP 1.1 Entity tag for the bucket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid=no\n\n\nThe ID of the bucket.

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.    -r .billing    requester-pays=true   When set to true, Requester Pays is enabled for this bucket.     ..    default-event-based-hold=true   The default value for event-based hold on newly created objects in this bucket. Event-based hold is a way to retain objects indefinitely until an event occurs, signified by the hold s release. After being released, such objects will be subject to bucket-level retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false. Objects under event-based hold cannot be deleted, overwritten or archived until the hold is removed.     encryption    default-kms-key-name=elitr   A Cloud KMS key that will be used to encrypt objects inserted into this bucket, if no encryption method is specified.     ..    etag=amet   HTTP 1.1 Entity tag for the bucket.    id=no  The ID of the bucket. For buckets, the id and name properties are the same.    kind=labore  The kind of item this is. For buckets, this is always storage#bucket.    labels=key=eirmod  User-provided labels, in key/value pairs.  the value will be associated with the given  key    location=dolore  The location of the bucket. Object data for objects in the bucket resides in physical storage within this region. Defaults to US. See the developer s guide for the authoritative list.    logging    log-bucket=invidunt  The destination bucket where the current bucket s logs should be placed.     log-object-prefix=aliquyam   A prefix for log object names.     ..    metageneration=accusam   The metadata generation of this bucket.    name=lorem  The name of the bucket.    owner    entity=sea  The entity, in the form project-owner-projectId.     entity-id=et   The ID for the entity.     ..    project-number=duo   The project number of the project the bucket belongs to.    retention-policy    effective-time=et  Server-determined value that indicates the time from which policy was enforced and effective. This value is in RFC 3339 format.    is-locked=true  Once locked, an object retention policy cannot be modified.     retention-period=sanctus   The duration in seconds that objects need to be retained. Retention duration must be greater than zero and less than 100 years. Note that enforcement of retention periods less than a day is not guaranteed. Such periods should only be used for testing purposes.     ..    self-link=et   The URI of this bucket.    storage-class=amet  The bucket s default storage class, used whenever no storageClass is specified for a newly-created object.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nBucket:\n  billing:\n    requester-pays: boolean\n  default-event-based-hold: boolean\n  encryption:\n    default-kms-key-name: string\n  etag: string\n  id: string\n  kind: string\n  labels: { string: string }\n  location: string\n  logging:\n    log-bucket: string\n    log-object-prefix: string\n  metageneration: string\n  name: string\n  owner:\n    entity: string\n    entity-id: string\n  project-number: string\n  retention-policy:\n    effective-time: string\n    is-locked: boolean\n    retention-period: string\n  self-link: string\n  storage-class: string\n  time-created: string\n  updated: string\n  versioning:\n    enabled: boolean\n  website:\n    main-page-suffix: string\n    not-found-page: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order.

Event-based hold is a way to retain objects indefinitely until an event occurs, signified by the hold\ns release. After being released, such objects will be subject to bucket-level retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level.

Event-based hold is a way to retain objects indefinitely until an event occurs, signified by the hold\ns release. After being released, such objects will be subject to bucket-level retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false.

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.    -r .billing    requester-pays=true   When set to true, Requester Pays is enabled for this bucket.     ..    default-event-based-hold=true   The default value for event-based hold on newly created objects in this bucket. Event-based hold is a way to retain objects indefinitely until an event occurs, signified by the hold s release. After being released, such objects will be subject to bucket-level retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false. Objects under event-based hold cannot be deleted, overwritten or archived until the hold is removed.     encryption    default-kms-key-name=sanctus   A Cloud KMS key that will be used to encrypt objects inserted into this bucket, if no encryption method is specified.     ..    etag=takimata   HTTP 1.1 Entity tag for the bucket.    id=at  The ID of the bucket. For buckets, the id and name properties are the same.    kind=labore  The kind of item this is. For buckets, this is always storage#bucket.    labels=key=invidunt  User-provided labels, in key/value pairs.  the value will be associated with the given  key    location=ea  The location of the bucket. Object data for objects in the bucket resides in physical storage within this region. Defaults to US. See the developer s guide for the authoritative list.    logging    log-bucket=sadipscing  The destination bucket where the current bucket s logs should be placed.     log-object-prefix=rebum.   A prefix for log object names.     ..    metageneration=dolore   The metadata generation of this bucket.    name=nonumy  The name of the bucket.    owner    entity=sed  The entity, in the form project-owner-projectId.     entity-id=aliquyam   The ID for the entity.     ..    project-number=sit   The project number of the project the bucket belongs to.    retention-policy    effective-time=eirmod  Server-determined value that indicates the time from which policy was enforced and effective. This value is in RFC 3339 format.    is-locked=true  Once locked, an object retention policy cannot be modified.     retention-period=labore   The duration in seconds that objects need to be retained. Retention duration must be greater than zero and less than 100 years. Note that enforcement of retention periods less than a day is not guaranteed. Such periods should only be used for testing purposes.     ..    self-link=sed   The URI of this bucket.    storage-class=ea  The bucket s default storage class, used whenever no storageClass is specified for a newly-created object. This defines how objects in the bucket are stored and determines the SLA and the cost of storage. Values include MULTI_REGIONAL, REGIONAL, STANDARD, NEARLINE, COLDLINE, and DURABLE_REDUCED_AVAILABILITY. If this value is not specified when the bucket is created, it will default to STANDARD. For more information, see storage classes.    time-created=gubergren  The creation time of the bucket in RFC 3339 format.    updated=aliquyam  The modification time of the bucket in RFC 3339 format.     versioning    enabled=true   While set to true, versioning is fully enabled for this bucket.     ..website    main-page-suffix=tempor   If the requested object path is missing, the service will ensure the path has a trailing  / , append this suffix, and attempt to retrieve the resulting object. This allows the creation of index.html objects to represent directory pages.    not-found-page=sea  If the requested object path is missing, and any mainPageSuffix object is missing, if applicable, the service will return the named object from this bucket as the content for a 404 Not Found result.",

For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call.

Event-based hold is a way to retain objects until an event occurs, which is signified by the hold\ns release (i.e. this value is set to false).

One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is the loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that.

Event-based hold is a way to retain objects until an event occurs, which is signified by the hold s release (i.e. this value is set to false). After being released (set to false), such objects will be subject to bucket-level retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is the loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false.    generation=clita  The content generation of this object.

If omitted, and the object is accessible to all anonymous users, the default will be public, max-age=3600.    component-count=8  Number of underlying components that make up this object. Components are accumulated by compose operations.    content-disposition=diam  Content-Disposition of the object data.    content-encoding=magna  Content-Encoding of the object data.    content-language=dolor  Content-Language of the object data.    content-type=lorem  Content-Type of the object data. If an object is stored without a Content-Type, it is served as application/octet-stream.    crc32c=dolor  CRC32c checksum, as described in RFC 4960, Appendix B; encoded using base64 in big-endian byte order. For more information about using the CRC32c checksum, see Hashes and ETags: Best Practices.    customer-encryption    encryption-algorithm=vero  The encryption algorithm.     key-sha256=nonumy   SHA256 hash value of the encryption key.     ..    etag=takimata   HTTP 1.1 Entity tag for the object.    event-based-hold=false  Whether an object is under event-based hold. Event-based hold is a way to retain objects until an event occurs, which is signified by the hold s release (i.e. this value is set to false). After being released (set to false), such objects will be subject to bucket-level retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is the loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false.    generation=consetetur  The content generation of this object. Used for object versioning.    id=erat  The ID of the object, including the bucket name, object name, and generation number.    kind=amet.  The kind of item this is. For objects, this is always storage#object.    kms-key-name=dolores  Cloud KMS Key used to encrypt this object, if the object is encrypted by such a key.    md5-hash=dolores  MD5 hash of the data; encoded using base64. For more information about using the MD5 hash, see Hashes and ETags: Best Practices.    media-link=et  Media download link.    metadata=key=sed  User-provided metadata, in key/value pairs.  the value will be associated with the given  key    metageneration=et  The version of the metadata for this object at this generation. Used for preconditions and for detecting changes in metadata. A metageneration number is only meaningful in the context of a particular generation of a particular object.    name=aliquyam  The name of the object. Required if not specified by URL parameter.    owner    entity=nonumy  The entity, in the form user-userId.     entity-id=sit   The ID for the entity.     ..    retention-expiration-time=aliquyam   A server-determined value that specifies the earliest time that the object s retention period expires. This value is in RFC 3339 format. Note 1: This field is not provided for objects with an active event-based hold, since retention expiration is unknown until the hold is removed. Note 2: This value can be provided even when temporary hold is set (so that the user can reason about policy without having to first unset the temporary hold).    self-link=sadipscing  The link to this object.    size=magna  Content-Length of the data in bytes.    storage-class=gubergren  Storage class of the object.    temporary-hold=false  Whether an object is under temporary hold. While this flag is set to true, the object is protected against deletion and overwrites. A common use case of this flag is regulatory investigations where objects need to be retained while the investigation is ongoing. Note that unlike event-based hold, temporary hold does not impact retention expiration time of an object.    time-created=gubergren  The creation time of the object in RFC 3339 format.    time-deleted=sit  The deletion time of the object in RFC 3339 format. Will be returned if and only if this version of the object has been deleted.    time-storage-class-updated=amet  The time at which the object s storage class was last changed. When the object is initially created, it will be set to timeCreated.    updated=eirmod  The modification time of the object metadata in RFC 3339 format.",

Event-based hold is a way to retain objects until an event occurs, which is signified by the hold\ns release (i.e. this value is set to false). After being released (set to false), such objects will be subject to bucket-level retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is the loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeneration=sit\n\n\nThe content generation of this object.

This value is in RFC 3339 format. Note 1: This field is not provided for objects with an active event-based hold, since retention expiration is unknown until the hold is removed. Note 2: This value can be provided even when temporary hold is set (so that the user can reason about policy without having to first unset the temporary hold).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nself-link=clita\n\n\nThe link to this object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsize=eos\n\n\nContent-Length of the data in bytes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstorage-class=amet\n\n\nStorage class of the object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntemporary-hold=false\n\n\nWhether an object is under temporary hold. While this flag is set to true, the object is protected against deletion and overwrites. A common use case of this flag is regulatory investigations where objects need to be retained while the investigation is ongoing. Note that unlike event-based hold, temporary hold does not impact retention expiration time of an object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntime-created=takimata\n\n\nThe creation time of the object in RFC 3339 format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntime-deleted=sit\n\n\nThe deletion time of the object in RFC 3339 format. Will be returned if and only if this version of the object has been deleted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntime-storage-class-updated=labore\n\n\nThe time at which the object\ns storage class was last changed. When the object is initially created, it will be set to timeCreated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nupdated=nonumy\n\n\nThe modification time of the object metadata in RFC 3339 format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nRequired Upload Flags\n\n\nThis method supports the upload of data, which \nrequires\n all of the following flags to be set:\n\n\n\n\n-u (simple|resumable)\n\n\nsimple\n - Upload media all at once.\n\n\nresumable\n - Upload media in a resumable fashion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-f file\n\n\nPath to file to upload.

Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is the loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that.

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n.

Event-based hold is a way to retain objects until an event occurs, which is signified by the hold s release (i.e. this value is set to false). After being released (set to false), such objects will be subject to bucket-level retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is the loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false.    generation=dolor  The content generation of this object.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.   -r .    bucket=magna  The name of the bucket containing this object.    cache-control=ut  Cache-Control directive for the object data. If omitted, and the object is accessible to all anonymous users, the default will be public, max-age=3600.    component-count=54  Number of underlying components that make up this object. Components are accumulated by compose operations.    content-disposition=sed  Content-Disposition of the object data.    content-encoding=sit  Content-Encoding of the object data.    content-language=sit  Content-Language of the object data.    content-type=dolores  Content-Type of the object data. If an object is stored without a Content-Type, it is served as application/octet-stream.    crc32c=et  CRC32c checksum, as described in RFC 4960, Appendix B; encoded using base64 in big-endian byte order. For more information about using the CRC32c checksum, see Hashes and ETags: Best Practices.    customer-encryption    encryption-algorithm=sanctus  The encryption algorithm.     key-sha256=takimata   SHA256 hash value of the encryption key.     ..    etag=kasd   HTTP 1.1 Entity tag for the object.    event-based-hold=true  Whether an object is under event-based hold. Event-based hold is a way to retain objects until an event occurs, which is signified by the hold s release (i.e. this value is set to false). After being released (set to false), such objects will be subject to bucket-level retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is the loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false.    generation=sadipscing  The content generation of this object. Used for object versioning.    id=et  The ID of the object, including the bucket name, object name, and generation number.    kind=clita  The kind of item this is. For objects, this is always storage#object.    kms-key-name=ipsum  Cloud KMS Key used to encrypt this object, if the object is encrypted by such a key.    md5-hash=dolor  MD5 hash of the data; encoded using base64. For more information about using the MD5 hash, see Hashes and ETags: Best Practices.    media-link=elitr  Media download link.    metadata=key=magna  User-provided metadata, in key/value pairs.  the value will be associated with the given  key    metageneration=aliquyam  The version of the metadata for this object at this generation. Used for preconditions and for detecting changes in metadata. A metageneration number is only meaningful in the context of a particular generation of a particular object.    name=kasd  The name of the object. Required if not specified by URL parameter.    owner    entity=duo  The entity, in the form user-userId.     entity-id=et   The ID for the entity.     ..    retention-expiration-time=sit   A server-determined value that specifies the earliest time that the object s retention period expires. This value is in RFC 3339 format. Note 1: This field is not provided for objects with an active event-based hold, since retention expiration is unknown until the hold is removed. Note 2: This value can be provided even when temporary hold is set (so that the user can reason about policy without having to first unset the temporary hold).    self-link=eirmod  The link to this object.    size=no  Content-Length of the data in bytes.    storage-class=lorem  Storage class of the object.    temporary-hold=true  Whether an object is under temporary hold. While this flag is set to true, the object is protected against deletion and overwrites. A common use case of this flag is regulatory investigations where objects need to be retained while the investigation is ongoing. Note that unlike event-based hold, temporary hold does not impact retention expiration time of an object.    time-created=tempor  The creation time of the object in RFC 3339 format.    time-deleted=clita  The deletion time of the object in RFC 3339 format. Will be returned if and only if this version of the object has been deleted.    time-storage-class-updated=kasd  The time at which the object s storage class was last changed. When the object is initially created, it will be set to timeCreated.    updated=elitr  The modification time of the object metadata in RFC 3339 format.",

Event-based hold is a way to retain objects until an event occurs, which is signified by the hold\ns release (i.e. this value is set to false). After being released (set to false), such objects will be subject to bucket-level retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is the loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeneration=consetetur\n\n\nThe content generation of this object.

This value is in RFC 3339 format. Note 1: This field is not provided for objects with an active event-based hold, since retention expiration is unknown until the hold is removed. Note 2: This value can be provided even when temporary hold is set (so that the user can reason about policy without having to first unset the temporary hold).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nself-link=erat\n\n\nThe link to this object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsize=voluptua.\n\n\nContent-Length of the data in bytes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstorage-class=est\n\n\nStorage class of the object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntemporary-hold=false\n\n\nWhether an object is under temporary hold. While this flag is set to true, the object is protected against deletion and overwrites. A common use case of this flag is regulatory investigations where objects need to be retained while the investigation is ongoing. Note that unlike event-based hold, temporary hold does not impact retention expiration time of an object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntime-created=tempor\n\n\nThe creation time of the object in RFC 3339 format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntime-deleted=amet\n\n\nThe deletion time of the object in RFC 3339 format.

When the object is initially created, it will be set to timeCreated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nupdated=eirmod\n\n\nThe modification time of the object metadata in RFC 3339 format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call.

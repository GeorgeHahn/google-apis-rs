You can change the directory used to store configuration with the \n--config-dir\n flag on a per-invocation basis.\n\n\nMore information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMost APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the \nscope\n determines the \nset of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/monitoring3-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/monitoring3-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \nmonitoring\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \nmonitoring3 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nGroup:\n  display-name: string\n  filter: string\n  is-cluster: boolean\n  name: string\n  parent-name: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order.

For groups with no parent, parentName is the empty string, \n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call.

For example:\n    metric.type =  compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu/usage_time  AND\n        metric.label.instance_name =  my-instance-name     -p aggregation-alignment-period=string   The alignment period for per-time series alignment. If present, alignmentPeriod must be at least 60 seconds. After per-time series alignment, each time series will contain data points only on the period boundaries. If perSeriesAligner is not specified or equals ALIGN_NONE, then this field is ignored. If perSeriesAligner is specified and does not equal ALIGN_NONE, then this field must be defined; otherwise an error is returned.     -p aggregation-cross-series-reducer=string   The approach to be used to combine time series. Not all reducer functions may be applied to all time series, depending on the metric type and the value type of the original time series. Reduction may change the metric type of value type of the time series.Time series data must be aligned in order to perform cross-time series reduction.

When view field sets to FULL, it limits the number of Points server will return; if view field is HEADERS, it limits the number of TimeSeries server will return.     -p aggregation-group-by-fields=string   The set of fields to preserve when crossSeriesReducer is specified. The groupByFields determine how the time series are partitioned into subsets prior to applying the aggregation function. Each subset contains time series that have the same value for each of the grouping fields. Each individual time series is a member of exactly one subset. The crossSeriesReducer is applied to each subset of time series. It is not possible to reduce across different resource types, so this field implicitly contains resource.type. Fields not specified in groupByFields are aggregated away. If groupByFields is not specified and all the time series have the same resource type, then the time series are aggregated into a single output time series. If crossSeriesReducer is not defined, this field is ignored.     -p view=string   Specifies which information is returned about the time series.     -p page-token=string   If this field is not empty then it must contain the nextPageToken value returned by a previous call to this method. Using this field causes the method to return additional results from the previous method call.     -p interval-end-time=string   Required. The end of the time interval.",

If two headers have the same key and different values, they should be entered as a single header, with the value being a comma-separated list of all the desired values as described at https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.txt (page 31). Entering two separate headers with the same key in a Create call will cause the first to be overwritten by the second.\n\n\nthe value will be associated with the given \nkey\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmask-headers=true\n\n\nBoolean specifiying whether to encrypt the header information. Encryption should be specified for any headers related to authentication that you do not wish to be seen when retrieving the configuration. The server will be responsible for encrypting the headers. On Get/List calls, if mask_headers is set to True then the headers will be obscured with \n*\n*.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npath=dolore\n\n\nThe path to the page to run the check against. Will be combined with the host (specified within the MonitoredResource) and port to construct the full URL. Optional (defaults to \n/\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nport=64\n\n\nThe port to the page to run the check against. Will be combined with host (specified within the MonitoredResource) and path to construct the full URL. Optional (defaults to 80 without SSL, or 443 with SSL).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuse-ssl=false\n\n\n\n\nIf true, use HTTPS instead of HTTP to run the check.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    is-internal=false\n\n\n\n\nDenotes whether this check is a check that egresses from InternalCheckers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmonitored-resource    labels=key=lorem\n\n\nRequired. Values for all of the labels listed in the associated monitored resource descriptor.

If this field is specified, enough regions to include a minimum of 3 locations must be provided, or an error message is returned. Not specifying this field will result in uptime checks running from all regions.\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntcp-check    port=79\n\n\n\n\nThe port to the page to run the check against. Will be combined with host (specified within the MonitoredResource) to construct the full URL. Required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    timeout=amet\n\n\n\n\nThe maximum amount of time to wait for the request to complete (must be between 1 and 60 seconds). Required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.   -r .    display-name=elitr  A human-friendly name for the uptime check configuration. The display name should be unique within a Stackdriver Account in order to make it easier to identify; however, uniqueness is not enforced. Required.    http-check.auth-info    password=amet  The password to authenticate.     username=no   The username to authenticate.     ..    headers=key=labore   The list of headers to send as part of the uptime check request. If two headers have the same key and different values, they should be entered as a single header, with the value being a comma-separated list of all the desired values as described at https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.txt (page 31). Entering two separate headers with the same key in a Create call will cause the first to be overwritten by the second.  the value will be associated with the given  key    mask-headers=true  Boolean specifiying whether to encrypt the header information. Encryption should be specified for any headers related to authentication that you do not wish to be seen when retrieving the configuration. The server will be responsible for encrypting the headers. On Get/List calls, if mask_headers is set to True then the headers will be obscured with  * *.    path=dolore  The path to the page to run the check against. Will be combined with the host (specified within the MonitoredResource) and port to construct the full URL. Optional (defaults to  / ).    port=64  The port to the page to run the check against. Will be combined with host (specified within the MonitoredResource) and path to construct the full URL. Optional (defaults to 80 without SSL, or 443 with SSL).     use-ssl=false   If true, use HTTPS instead of HTTP to run the check.     ..    is-internal=false   Denotes whether this check is a check that egresses from InternalCheckers.    monitored-resource    labels=key=lorem  Required. Values for all of the labels listed in the associated monitored resource descriptor. For example, Compute Engine VM instances use the labels  project_id ,  instance_id , and  zone .  the value will be associated with the given  key     type=sea   Required. The monitored resource type. This field must match the type field of a MonitoredResourceDescriptor object. For example, the type of a Compute Engine VM instance is gce_instance.     ..    name=et   A unique resource name for this UptimeCheckConfig. The format is:projects/[PROJECT_ID]/uptimeCheckConfigs/[UPTIME_CHECK_ID].This field should be omitted when creating the uptime check configuration; on create, the resource name is assigned by the server and included in the response.    period=duo  How often the uptime check is performed. Currently, only 1, 5, 10, and 15 minutes are supported. Required.    resource-group    group-id=et  The group of resources being monitored. Should be only the group_id, not projects/ project_id /groups/ group_id .     resource-type=eirmod   The resource type of the group members.     ..    selected-regions=sanctus   The list of regions from which the check will be run. If this field is specified, enough regions to include a minimum of 3 locations must be provided, or an error message is returned. Not specifying this field will result in uptime checks running from all regions.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.     tcp-check    port=79   The port to the page to run the check against. Will be combined with host (specified within the MonitoredResource) to construct the full URL. Required.     ..    timeout=amet   The maximum amount of time to wait for the request to complete (must be between 1 and 60 seconds). Required.",

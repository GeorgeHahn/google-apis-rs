You can change the directory used to store configuration with the \n--config-dir\n flag on a per-invocation basis.\n\n\nMore information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMost APIs require a user to authenticate any request.

The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/calendar3-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/calendar3-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \ncalendar\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \ncalendar3 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

It is used to uniquely identify events accross calendaring systems and must be supplied when importing events via the import method.\n    Note that the icalUID and the id are not identical and only one of them should be supplied at event creation time. One difference in their semantics is that in recurring events, all occurrences of one event have different ids while they all share the same icalUIDs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid=ut\n\n\nOpaque identifier of the event. When creating new single or recurring events, you can specify their IDs.

To minimize the risk of collisions we recommend using an established UUID algorithm such as one described in RFC4122.\nIf you do not specify an ID, it will be automatically generated by the server.\nNote that the icalUID and the id are not identical and only one of them should be supplied at event creation time. One difference in their semantics is that in recurring events, all occurrences of one event have different ids while they all share the same icalUIDs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkind=amet.\n\n\nType of the resource (\ncalendar#event\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlocation=ipsum\n\n\nGeographic location of the event as free-form text.

A time zone offset is required unless a time zone is explicitly specified in timeZone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntime-zone=dolor\n\n\n\n\nThe time zone in which the time is specified. (Formatted as an IANA Time Zone Database name, e.g. \nEurope/Zurich\n.) For recurring events this field is required and specifies the time zone in which the recurrence is expanded. For single events this field is optional and indicates a custom time zone for the event start/end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    private-copy=true\n\n\n\n\nWhether this is a private event copy where changes are not shared with other copies on other calendars. Optional. Immutable. The default is False.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrecurrence=et\n\n\nList of RRULE, EXRULE, RDATE and EXDATE lines for a recurring event, as specified in RFC5545. Note that DTSTART and DTEND lines are not allowed in this field; event start and end times are specified in the start and end fields. This field is omitted for single events or instances of recurring events.\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrecurring-event-id=vero\n\n\nFor an instance of a recurring event, this is the id of the recurring event to which this instance belongs.

A time zone offset is required unless a time zone is explicitly specified in timeZone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntime-zone=vero\n\n\n\n\nThe time zone in which the time is specified. (Formatted as an IANA Time Zone Database name, e.g. \nEurope/Zurich\n.) For recurring events this field is required and specifies the time zone in which the recurrence is expanded. For single events this field is optional and indicates a custom time zone for the event start/end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    status=dolor\n\n\n\n\nStatus of the event. Optional. Possible values are:  \n\n\nconfirmed\n - The event is confirmed. This is the default status. \n\n\ntentative\n - The event is tentatively confirmed. \n\n\ncancelled\n - The event is cancelled (deleted). The list method returns cancelled events only on incremental sync (when syncToken or updatedMin are specified) or if the showDeleted flag is set to true. The get method always returns them.\nA cancelled status represents two different states depending on the event type:  \n\n\nCancelled exceptions of an uncancelled recurring event indicate that this instance should no longer be presented to the user. Clients should store these events for the lifetime of the parent recurring event.\nCancelled exceptions are only guaranteed to have values for the id, recurringEventId and originalStartTime fields populated. The other fields might be empty.  \n\n\nAll other cancelled events represent deleted events. Clients should remove their locally synced copies. Such cancelled events will eventually disappear, so do not rely on them being available indefinitely.\nDeleted events are only guaranteed to have the id field populated.   On the organizer\ns calendar, cancelled events continue to expose event details (summary, location, etc.) so that they can be restored (undeleted). Similarly, the events to which the user was invited and that they manually removed continue to provide details. However, incremental sync requests with showDeleted set to false will not return these details.\nIf an event changes its organizer (for example via the move operation) and the original organizer is not on the attendee list, it will leave behind a cancelled event where only the id field is guaranteed to be populated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummary=takimata\n\n\nTitle of the event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntransparency=et\n\n\nWhether the event blocks time on the calendar. Optional. Possible values are:  \n\n\nopaque\n - Default value. The event does block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting Show me as to Busy in the Calendar UI. \n\n\ntransparent\n - The event does not block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting Show me as to Available in the Calendar UI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nupdated=nonumy\n\n\nLast modification time of the event (as a RFC3339 timestamp). Read-only.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvisibility=et\n\n\nVisibility of the event. Optional. Possible values are:  \n\n\ndefault\n - Uses the default visibility for events on the calendar. This is the default value. \n\n\npublic\n - The event is public and event details are visible to all readers of the calendar. \n\n\nprivate\n - The event is private and only event attendees may view event details. \n\n\nconfidential\n - The event is private. This value is provided for compatibility reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that \n-p\n is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this \n-p k1=v1 k2=v2\n even though the listing below repeats the\n\n-p\n for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p conference-data-version=integer\n\n\n\n\nVersion number of conference data supported by the API client. Version 0 assumes no conference data support and ignores conference data in the event\ns body. Version 1 enables support for copying of ConferenceData as well as for creating new conferences using the createRequest field of conferenceData. The default is 0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p supports-attachments=boolean\n\n\n\n\nWhether API client performing operation supports event attachments. Optional.

A time zone offset is required unless a time zone is explicitly specified in timeZone.     time-zone=invidunt   The time zone in which the time is specified. (Formatted as an IANA Time Zone Database name, e.g.  Europe/Zurich .) For recurring events this field is required and specifies the time zone in which the recurrence is expanded. For single events this field is optional and indicates a custom time zone for the event start/end.     ..    end-time-unspecified=true   Whether the end time is actually unspecified.

Read-only.    html-link=diam  An absolute link to this event in the Google Calendar Web UI. Read-only.    i-cal-uid=ut  Event unique identifier as defined in RFC5545. It is used to uniquely identify events accross calendaring systems and must be supplied when importing events via the import method.\n    Note that the icalUID and the id are not identical and only one of them should be supplied at event creation time. One difference in their semantics is that in recurring events, all occurrences of one event have different ids while they all share the same icalUIDs.    id=ut  Opaque identifier of the event. When creating new single or recurring events, you can specify their IDs. Provided IDs must follow these rules:    characters allowed in the ID are those used in base32hex encoding, i.e. lowercase letters a-v and digits 0-9, see section 3.1.2 in RFC2938   the length of the ID must be between 5 and 1024 characters   the ID must be unique per calendar  Due to the globally distributed nature of the system, we cannot guarantee that ID collisions will be detected at event creation time. To minimize the risk of collisions we recommend using an established UUID algorithm such as one described in RFC4122.\nIf you do not specify an ID, it will be automatically generated by the server.\nNote that the icalUID and the id are not identical and only one of them should be supplied at event creation time. One difference in their semantics is that in recurring events, all occurrences of one event have different ids while they all share the same icalUIDs.      kind=amet.  Type of the resource ( calendar#event ).    location=ipsum  Geographic location of the event as free-form text. Optional.    locked=false  Whether this is a locked event copy where no changes can be made to the main event fields  summary ,  description ,  location ,  start ,  end  or  recurrence . The default is False. Read-Only.    organizer    display-name=dolor  The organizer s name, if available.    email=sea  The organizer s email address, if available. It must be a valid email address as per RFC5322.    id=ut  The organizer s Profile ID, if available. It corresponds to the id field in the People collection of the Google+ API     self=true   Whether the organizer corresponds to the calendar on which this copy of the event appears. Read-only. The default is False.     ..original-start-time    date=sanctus   The date, in the format  yyyy-mm-dd , if this is an all-day event.    date-time=voluptua.  The time, as a combined date-time value (formatted according to RFC3339). A time zone offset is required unless a time zone is explicitly specified in timeZone.     time-zone=dolor   The time zone in which the time is specified. (Formatted as an IANA Time Zone Database name, e.g.  Europe/Zurich .) For recurring events this field is required and specifies the time zone in which the recurrence is expanded. For single events this field is optional and indicates a custom time zone for the event start/end.     ..    private-copy=true   Whether this is a private event copy where changes are not shared with other copies on other calendars. Optional. Immutable. The default is False.    recurrence=et  List of RRULE, EXRULE, RDATE and EXDATE lines for a recurring event, as specified in RFC5545. Note that DTSTART and DTEND lines are not allowed in this field; event start and end times are specified in the start and end fields. This field is omitted for single events or instances of recurring events.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    recurring-event-id=vero  For an instance of a recurring event, this is the id of the recurring event to which this instance belongs. Immutable.     reminders    use-default=true   Whether the default reminders of the calendar apply to the event.     ..    sequence=71   Sequence number as per iCalendar.    source    title=et  Title of the source; for example a title of a web page or an email subject.     url=ipsum   URL of the source pointing to a resource. The URL scheme must be HTTP or HTTPS.     ..start    date=justo   The date, in the format  yyyy-mm-dd , if this is an all-day event.    date-time=dolore  The time, as a combined date-time value (formatted according to RFC3339). A time zone offset is required unless a time zone is explicitly specified in timeZone.     time-zone=vero   The time zone in which the time is specified. (Formatted as an IANA Time Zone Database name, e.g.  Europe/Zurich .) For recurring events this field is required and specifies the time zone in which the recurrence is expanded. For single events this field is optional and indicates a custom time zone for the event start/end.     ..    status=dolor   Status of the event. Optional. Possible values are:    confirmed  - The event is confirmed. This is the default status.   tentative  - The event is tentatively confirmed.   cancelled  - The event is cancelled (deleted). The list method returns cancelled events only on incremental sync (when syncToken or updatedMin are specified) or if the showDeleted flag is set to true. The get method always returns them.\nA cancelled status represents two different states depending on the event type:    Cancelled exceptions of an uncancelled recurring event indicate that this instance should no longer be presented to the user. Clients should store these events for the lifetime of the parent recurring event.\nCancelled exceptions are only guaranteed to have values for the id, recurringEventId and originalStartTime fields populated. The other fields might be empty.    All other cancelled events represent deleted events. Clients should remove their locally synced copies. Such cancelled events will eventually disappear, so do not rely on them being available indefinitely.\nDeleted events are only guaranteed to have the id field populated.   On the organizer s calendar, cancelled events continue to expose event details (summary, location, etc.) so that they can be restored (undeleted). Similarly, the events to which the user was invited and that they manually removed continue to provide details. However, incremental sync requests with showDeleted set to false will not return these details.\nIf an event changes its organizer (for example via the move operation) and the original organizer is not on the attendee list, it will leave behind a cancelled event where only the id field is guaranteed to be populated.      summary=takimata  Title of the event.    transparency=et  Whether the event blocks time on the calendar. Optional. Possible values are:    opaque  - Default value. The event does block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting Show me as to Busy in the Calendar UI.   transparent  - The event does not block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting Show me as to Available in the Calendar UI.      updated=nonumy  Last modification time of the event (as a RFC3339 timestamp). Read-only.    visibility=et  Visibility of the event. Optional. Possible values are:    default  - Uses the default visibility for events on the calendar. This is the default value.   public  - The event is public and event details are visible to all readers of the calendar.   private  - The event is private and only event attendees may view event details.   confidential  - The event is private. This value is provided for compatibility reasons.",

Possible values are:  \n\n\nconfirmed\n - The event is confirmed. This is the default status. \n\n\ntentative\n - The event is tentatively confirmed. \n\n\ncancelled\n - The event is cancelled (deleted). The list method returns cancelled events only on incremental sync (when syncToken or updatedMin are specified) or if the showDeleted flag is set to true. The get method always returns them.\nA cancelled status represents two different states depending on the event type:  \n\n\nCancelled exceptions of an uncancelled recurring event indicate that this instance should no longer be presented to the user. Clients should store these events for the lifetime of the parent recurring event.\nCancelled exceptions are only guaranteed to have values for the id, recurringEventId and originalStartTime fields populated. The other fields might be empty.  \n\n\nAll other cancelled events represent deleted events. Clients should remove their locally synced copies. Such cancelled events will eventually disappear, so do not rely on them being available indefinitely.\nDeleted events are only guaranteed to have the id field populated.   On the organizer\ns calendar, cancelled events continue to expose event details (summary, location, etc.) so that they can be restored (undeleted). Similarly, the events to which the user was invited and that they manually removed continue to provide details. However, incremental sync requests with showDeleted set to false will not return these details.\nIf an event changes its organizer (for example via the move operation) and the original organizer is not on the attendee list, it will leave behind a cancelled event where only the id field is guaranteed to be populated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummary=nonumy\n\n\nTitle of the event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntransparency=sed\n\n\nWhether the event blocks time on the calendar. Optional. Possible values are:  \n\n\nopaque\n - Default value. The event does block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting Show me as to Busy in the Calendar UI. \n\n\ntransparent\n - The event does not block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting Show me as to Available in the Calendar UI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nupdated=diam\n\n\nLast modification time of the event (as a RFC3339 timestamp). Read-only.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvisibility=magna\n\n\nVisibility of the event. Optional. Possible values are:  \n\n\ndefault\n - Uses the default visibility for events on the calendar. This is the default value. \n\n\npublic\n - The event is public and event details are visible to all readers of the calendar. \n\n\nprivate\n - The event is private and only event attendees may view event details. \n\n\nconfidential\n - The event is private. This value is provided for compatibility reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that \n-p\n is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this \n-p k1=v1 k2=v2\n even though the listing below repeats the\n\n-p\n for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p max-attendees=integer\n\n\n\n\nThe maximum number of attendees to include in the response. If there are more than the specified number of attendees, only the participant is returned. Optional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p send-notifications=boolean\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeprecated. Please use sendUpdates instead.\n\n\nWhether to send notifications about the creation of the new event. Note that some emails might still be sent even if you set the value to false. The default is false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p send-updates=string\n\n\n\n\nWhether to send notifications about the creation of the new event. Note that some emails might still be sent.

The default is False.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p conference-data-version=integer\n\n\n\n\nVersion number of conference data supported by the API client. Version 0 assumes no conference data support and ignores conference data in the event\ns body. Version 1 enables support for copying of ConferenceData as well as for creating new conferences using the createRequest field of conferenceData. The default is 0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p oauth-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth 2.0 token for the current user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p pretty-print=boolean\n\n\n\n\nReturns response with indentations and line breaks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p quota-user=string\n\n\n\n\nAn opaque string that represents a user for quota purposes.

Optional.    locked=true  Whether this is a locked event copy where no changes can be made to the main event fields  summary ,  description ,  location ,  start ,  end  or  recurrence . The default is False. Read-Only.    organizer    display-name=consetetur  The organizer s name, if available.    email=vero  The organizer s email address, if available. It must be a valid email address as per RFC5322.    id=consetetur  The organizer s Profile ID, if available. It corresponds to the id field in the People collection of the Google+ API     self=true   Whether the organizer corresponds to the calendar on which this copy of the event appears. Read-only. The default is False.     ..original-start-time    date=justo   The date, in the format  yyyy-mm-dd , if this is an all-day event.    date-time=tempor  The time, as a combined date-time value (formatted according to RFC3339). A time zone offset is required unless a time zone is explicitly specified in timeZone.     time-zone=gubergren   The time zone in which the time is specified. (Formatted as an IANA Time Zone Database name, e.g.  Europe/Zurich .) For recurring events this field is required and specifies the time zone in which the recurrence is expanded. For single events this field is optional and indicates a custom time zone for the event start/end.     ..    private-copy=false   Whether this is a private event copy where changes are not shared with other copies on other calendars. Optional. Immutable. The default is False.    recurrence=amet.  List of RRULE, EXRULE, RDATE and EXDATE lines for a recurring event, as specified in RFC5545. Note that DTSTART and DTEND lines are not allowed in this field; event start and end times are specified in the start and end fields. This field is omitted for single events or instances of recurring events.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    recurring-event-id=dolore  For an instance of a recurring event, this is the id of the recurring event to which this instance belongs. Immutable.     reminders    use-default=false   Whether the default reminders of the calendar apply to the event.     ..    sequence=7   Sequence number as per iCalendar.    source    title=magna  Title of the source; for example a title of a web page or an email subject.     url=ipsum   URL of the source pointing to a resource. The URL scheme must be HTTP or HTTPS.     ..start    date=invidunt   The date, in the format  yyyy-mm-dd , if this is an all-day event.    date-time=accusam  The time, as a combined date-time value (formatted according to RFC3339). A time zone offset is required unless a time zone is explicitly specified in timeZone.     time-zone=labore   The time zone in which the time is specified. (Formatted as an IANA Time Zone Database name, e.g.  Europe/Zurich .) For recurring events this field is required and specifies the time zone in which the recurrence is expanded. For single events this field is optional and indicates a custom time zone for the event start/end.     ..    status=diam   Status of the event. Optional. Possible values are:    confirmed  - The event is confirmed. This is the default status.   tentative  - The event is tentatively confirmed.   cancelled  - The event is cancelled (deleted). The list method returns cancelled events only on incremental sync (when syncToken or updatedMin are specified) or if the showDeleted flag is set to true. The get method always returns them.\nA cancelled status represents two different states depending on the event type:    Cancelled exceptions of an uncancelled recurring event indicate that this instance should no longer be presented to the user. Clients should store these events for the lifetime of the parent recurring event.\nCancelled exceptions are only guaranteed to have values for the id, recurringEventId and originalStartTime fields populated. The other fields might be empty.    All other cancelled events represent deleted events. Clients should remove their locally synced copies. Such cancelled events will eventually disappear, so do not rely on them being available indefinitely.\nDeleted events are only guaranteed to have the id field populated.   On the organizer s calendar, cancelled events continue to expose event details (summary, location, etc.) so that they can be restored (undeleted). Similarly, the events to which the user was invited and that they manually removed continue to provide details. However, incremental sync requests with showDeleted set to false will not return these details.\nIf an event changes its organizer (for example via the move operation) and the original organizer is not on the attendee list, it will leave behind a cancelled event where only the id field is guaranteed to be populated.      summary=nonumy  Title of the event.    transparency=sed  Whether the event blocks time on the calendar. Optional. Possible values are:    opaque  - Default value. The event does block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting Show me as to Busy in the Calendar UI.   transparent  - The event does not block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting Show me as to Available in the Calendar UI.      updated=diam  Last modification time of the event (as a RFC3339 timestamp). Read-only.    visibility=magna  Visibility of the event. Optional. Possible values are:    default  - Uses the default visibility for events on the calendar. This is the default value.   public  - The event is public and event details are visible to all readers of the calendar.   private  - The event is private and only event attendees may view event details.   confidential  - The event is private. This value is provided for compatibility reasons.",

(Formatted as an IANA Time Zone Database name, e.g. \nEurope/Zurich\n.) For recurring events this field is required and specifies the time zone in which the recurrence is expanded. For single events this field is optional and indicates a custom time zone for the event start/end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    private-copy=true\n\n\n\n\nWhether this is a private event copy where changes are not shared with other copies on other calendars. Optional. Immutable. The default is False.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrecurrence=eos\n\n\nList of RRULE, EXRULE, RDATE and EXDATE lines for a recurring event, as specified in RFC5545. Note that DTSTART and DTEND lines are not allowed in this field; event start and end times are specified in the start and end fields. This field is omitted for single events or instances of recurring events.\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrecurring-event-id=amet\n\n\nFor an instance of a recurring event, this is the id of the recurring event to which this instance belongs.

A time zone offset is required unless a time zone is explicitly specified in timeZone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntime-zone=gubergren\n\n\n\n\nThe time zone in which the time is specified. (Formatted as an IANA Time Zone Database name, e.g. \nEurope/Zurich\n.) For recurring events this field is required and specifies the time zone in which the recurrence is expanded. For single events this field is optional and indicates a custom time zone for the event start/end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    status=erat\n\n\n\n\nStatus of the event. Optional. Possible values are:  \n\n\nconfirmed\n - The event is confirmed. This is the default status. \n\n\ntentative\n - The event is tentatively confirmed. \n\n\ncancelled\n - The event is cancelled (deleted). The list method returns cancelled events only on incremental sync (when syncToken or updatedMin are specified) or if the showDeleted flag is set to true. The get method always returns them.\nA cancelled status represents two different states depending on the event type:  \n\n\nCancelled exceptions of an uncancelled recurring event indicate that this instance should no longer be presented to the user. Clients should store these events for the lifetime of the parent recurring event.\nCancelled exceptions are only guaranteed to have values for the id, recurringEventId and originalStartTime fields populated. The other fields might be empty.  \n\n\nAll other cancelled events represent deleted events. Clients should remove their locally synced copies. Such cancelled events will eventually disappear, so do not rely on them being available indefinitely.\nDeleted events are only guaranteed to have the id field populated.   On the organizer\ns calendar, cancelled events continue to expose event details (summary, location, etc.) so that they can be restored (undeleted). Similarly, the events to which the user was invited and that they manually removed continue to provide details. However, incremental sync requests with showDeleted set to false will not return these details.\nIf an event changes its organizer (for example via the move operation) and the original organizer is not on the attendee list, it will leave behind a cancelled event where only the id field is guaranteed to be populated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummary=et\n\n\nTitle of the event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntransparency=amet\n\n\nWhether the event blocks time on the calendar. Optional. Possible values are:  \n\n\nopaque\n - Default value. The event does block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting Show me as to Busy in the Calendar UI. \n\n\ntransparent\n - The event does not block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting Show me as to Available in the Calendar UI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nupdated=lorem\n\n\nLast modification time of the event (as a RFC3339 timestamp). Read-only.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvisibility=voluptua.\n\n\nVisibility of the event. Optional. Possible values are:  \n\n\ndefault\n - Uses the default visibility for events on the calendar. This is the default value. \n\n\npublic\n - The event is public and event details are visible to all readers of the calendar. \n\n\nprivate\n - The event is private and only event attendees may view event details. \n\n\nconfidential\n - The event is private. This value is provided for compatibility reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that \n-p\n is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this \n-p k1=v1 k2=v2\n even though the listing below repeats the\n\n-p\n for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p send-updates=string\n\n\n\n\nGuests who should receive notifications about the event update (for example, title changes, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p conference-data-version=integer\n\n\n\n\nVersion number of conference data supported by the API client. Version 0 assumes no conference data support and ignores conference data in the event\ns body. Version 1 enables support for copying of ConferenceData as well as for creating new conferences using the createRequest field of conferenceData. The default is 0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p max-attendees=integer\n\n\n\n\nThe maximum number of attendees to include in the response. If there are more than the specified number of attendees, only the participant is returned. Optional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p always-include-email=boolean\n\n\n\n\nWhether to always include a value in the email field for the organizer, creator and attendees, even if no real email is available (i.e. a generated, non-working value will be provided). The use of this option is discouraged and should only be used by clients which cannot handle the absence of an email address value in the mentioned places. Optional. The default is False.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p supports-attachments=boolean\n\n\n\n\nWhether API client performing operation supports event attachments. Optional. The default is False.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p send-notifications=boolean\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeprecated. Please use sendUpdates instead.\n\n\nWhether to send notifications about the event update (for example, description changes, etc.). Note that some emails might still be sent even if you set the value to false. The default is false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p oauth-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth 2.0 token for the current user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p pretty-print=boolean\n\n\n\n\nReturns response with indentations and line breaks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p quota-user=string\n\n\n\n\nAn opaque string that represents a user for quota purposes. Must not exceed 40 characters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p user-ip=string\n\n\n\n\nDeprecated. Please use quotaUser instead.",

This field is omitted for single events or instances of recurring events.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    recurring-event-id=amet  For an instance of a recurring event, this is the id of the recurring event to which this instance belongs. Immutable.     reminders    use-default=false   Whether the default reminders of the calendar apply to the event.     ..    sequence=93   Sequence number as per iCalendar.    source    title=sit  Title of the source; for example a title of a web page or an email subject.     url=labore   URL of the source pointing to a resource. The URL scheme must be HTTP or HTTPS.     ..start    date=nonumy   The date, in the format  yyyy-mm-dd , if this is an all-day event.    date-time=erat  The time, as a combined date-time value (formatted according to RFC3339). A time zone offset is required unless a time zone is explicitly specified in timeZone.     time-zone=gubergren   The time zone in which the time is specified. (Formatted as an IANA Time Zone Database name, e.g.  Europe/Zurich .) For recurring events this field is required and specifies the time zone in which the recurrence is expanded. For single events this field is optional and indicates a custom time zone for the event start/end.     ..    status=erat   Status of the event. Optional. Possible values are:    confirmed  - The event is confirmed. This is the default status.   tentative  - The event is tentatively confirmed.   cancelled  - The event is cancelled (deleted). The list method returns cancelled events only on incremental sync (when syncToken or updatedMin are specified) or if the showDeleted flag is set to true. The get method always returns them.\nA cancelled status represents two different states depending on the event type:    Cancelled exceptions of an uncancelled recurring event indicate that this instance should no longer be presented to the user. Clients should store these events for the lifetime of the parent recurring event.\nCancelled exceptions are only guaranteed to have values for the id, recurringEventId and originalStartTime fields populated. The other fields might be empty.    All other cancelled events represent deleted events. Clients should remove their locally synced copies. Such cancelled events will eventually disappear, so do not rely on them being available indefinitely.\nDeleted events are only guaranteed to have the id field populated.   On the organizer s calendar, cancelled events continue to expose event details (summary, location, etc.) so that they can be restored (undeleted). Similarly, the events to which the user was invited and that they manually removed continue to provide details. However, incremental sync requests with showDeleted set to false will not return these details.\nIf an event changes its organizer (for example via the move operation) and the original organizer is not on the attendee list, it will leave behind a cancelled event where only the id field is guaranteed to be populated.      summary=et  Title of the event.    transparency=amet  Whether the event blocks time on the calendar. Optional. Possible values are:    opaque  - Default value. The event does block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting Show me as to Busy in the Calendar UI.   transparent  - The event does not block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting Show me as to Available in the Calendar UI.      updated=lorem  Last modification time of the event (as a RFC3339 timestamp). Read-only.    visibility=voluptua.  Visibility of the event. Optional. Possible values are:    default  - Uses the default visibility for events on the calendar. This is the default value.   public  - The event is public and event details are visible to all readers of the calendar.   private  - The event is private and only event attendees may view event details.   confidential  - The event is private. This value is provided for compatibility reasons.",

For single events this field is optional and indicates a custom time zone for the event start/end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    status=vero\n\n\n\n\nStatus of the event. Optional. Possible values are:  \n\n\nconfirmed\n - The event is confirmed. This is the default status. \n\n\ntentative\n - The event is tentatively confirmed. \n\n\ncancelled\n - The event is cancelled (deleted). The list method returns cancelled events only on incremental sync (when syncToken or updatedMin are specified) or if the showDeleted flag is set to true. The get method always returns them.\nA cancelled status represents two different states depending on the event type:  \n\n\nCancelled exceptions of an uncancelled recurring event indicate that this instance should no longer be presented to the user. Clients should store these events for the lifetime of the parent recurring event.\nCancelled exceptions are only guaranteed to have values for the id, recurringEventId and originalStartTime fields populated. The other fields might be empty.  \n\n\nAll other cancelled events represent deleted events. Clients should remove their locally synced copies. Such cancelled events will eventually disappear, so do not rely on them being available indefinitely.\nDeleted events are only guaranteed to have the id field populated.   On the organizer\ns calendar, cancelled events continue to expose event details (summary, location, etc.) so that they can be restored (undeleted). Similarly, the events to which the user was invited and that they manually removed continue to provide details. However, incremental sync requests with showDeleted set to false will not return these details.\nIf an event changes its organizer (for example via the move operation) and the original organizer is not on the attendee list, it will leave behind a cancelled event where only the id field is guaranteed to be populated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummary=nonumy\n\n\nTitle of the event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntransparency=magna\n\n\nWhether the event blocks time on the calendar. Optional. Possible values are:  \n\n\nopaque\n - Default value. The event does block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting Show me as to Busy in the Calendar UI. \n\n\ntransparent\n - The event does not block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting Show me as to Available in the Calendar UI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nupdated=ea\n\n\nLast modification time of the event (as a RFC3339 timestamp). Read-only.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvisibility=sea\n\n\nVisibility of the event. Optional. Possible values are:  \n\n\ndefault\n - Uses the default visibility for events on the calendar. This is the default value. \n\n\npublic\n - The event is public and event details are visible to all readers of the calendar. \n\n\nprivate\n - The event is private and only event attendees may view event details. \n\n\nconfidential\n - The event is private. This value is provided for compatibility reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that \n-p\n is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this \n-p k1=v1 k2=v2\n even though the listing below repeats the\n\n-p\n for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p send-updates=string\n\n\n\n\nGuests who should receive notifications about the event update (for example, title changes, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p max-attendees=integer\n\n\n\n\nThe maximum number of attendees to include in the response.

Version 0 assumes no conference data support and ignores conference data in the event\ns body. Version 1 enables support for copying of ConferenceData as well as for creating new conferences using the createRequest field of conferenceData. The default is 0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p supports-attachments=boolean\n\n\n\n\nWhether API client performing operation supports event attachments. Optional. The default is False.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p always-include-email=boolean\n\n\n\n\nWhether to always include a value in the email field for the organizer, creator and attendees, even if no real email is available (i.e. a generated, non-working value will be provided). The use of this option is discouraged and should only be used by clients which cannot handle the absence of an email address value in the mentioned places. Optional. The default is False.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p send-notifications=boolean\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeprecated. Please use sendUpdates instead.\n\n\nWhether to send notifications about the event update (for example, description changes, etc.). Note that some emails might still be sent even if you set the value to false. The default is false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

The list method returns cancelled events only on incremental sync (when syncToken or updatedMin are specified) or if the showDeleted flag is set to true. The get method always returns them.\nA cancelled status represents two different states depending on the event type:    Cancelled exceptions of an uncancelled recurring event indicate that this instance should no longer be presented to the user. Clients should store these events for the lifetime of the parent recurring event.\nCancelled exceptions are only guaranteed to have values for the id, recurringEventId and originalStartTime fields populated. The other fields might be empty.    All other cancelled events represent deleted events. Clients should remove their locally synced copies. Such cancelled events will eventually disappear, so do not rely on them being available indefinitely.\nDeleted events are only guaranteed to have the id field populated.   On the organizer s calendar, cancelled events continue to expose event details (summary, location, etc.) so that they can be restored (undeleted). Similarly, the events to which the user was invited and that they manually removed continue to provide details. However, incremental sync requests with showDeleted set to false will not return these details.\nIf an event changes its organizer (for example via the move operation) and the original organizer is not on the attendee list, it will leave behind a cancelled event where only the id field is guaranteed to be populated.      summary=nonumy  Title of the event.    transparency=magna  Whether the event blocks time on the calendar. Optional. Possible values are:    opaque  - Default value. The event does block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting Show me as to Busy in the Calendar UI.   transparent  - The event does not block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting Show me as to Available in the Calendar UI.      updated=ea  Last modification time of the event (as a RFC3339 timestamp). Read-only.    visibility=sea  Visibility of the event. Optional. Possible values are:    default  - Uses the default visibility for events on the calendar. This is the default value.   public  - The event is public and event details are visible to all readers of the calendar.   private  - The event is private and only event attendees may view event details.   confidential  - The event is private. This value is provided for compatibility reasons.",

You can change the directory used to store configuration with the \n--config-dir\n flag on a per-invocation basis.\n\n\nMore information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMost APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the \nscope\n determines the \nset of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/cloudresourcemanager1-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/cloudresourcemanager1-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \ncloudresourcemanager\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \ncloudresourcemanager1 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nClearOrgPolicyRequest:\n  constraint: string\n  etag: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .    constraint=eirmod\n\n\nName of the \nConstraint\n of the \nPolicy\n to clear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\netag=sit\n\n\nThe current version, for concurrency control. Not sending an \netag\n\n    will cause the \nPolicy\n to be cleared blindly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p bearer-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth bearer token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.  For example, a structure like this:  SetOrgPolicyRequest:\n  policy:\n    boolean-policy:\n      enforced: boolean\n    constraint: string\n    etag: string\n    list-policy:\n      all-values: string\n      allowed-values: [string]\n      denied-values: [string]\n      inherit-from-parent: boolean\n      suggested-value: string\n    update-time: string\n    version: integer  can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.    -r .policy.boolean-policy    enforced=true    If  true , then the  Policy  is enforced. If  false , then any\n    configuration is acceptable.  Suppose you have a  Constraint   constraints/compute.disableSerialPortAccess \nwith  constraint_default  set to  ALLOW . A  Policy  for that Constraint  exhibits the following behavior:\n  - If the  Policy  at this resource has enforced set to  false , serial\n    port connection attempts will be allowed.\n  - If the  Policy  at this resource has enforced set to  true , serial\n    port connection attempts will be refused.\n  - If the  Policy  at this resource is  RestoreDefault , serial port\n    connection attempts will be allowed.\n  - If no  Policy  is set at this resource or anywhere higher in the\n    resource hierarchy, serial port connection attempts will be allowed.\n  - If no  Policy  is set at this resource, but one exists higher in the\n    resource hierarchy, the behavior is as if the Policy  were set at\n    this resource.  The following examples demonstrate the different possible layerings:  Example 1 (nearest  Constraint  wins):\n   organizations/foo  has a  Policy  with:\n    {enforced: false}\n   projects/bar  has no  Policy  set.\nThe constraint at  projects/bar  and  organizations/foo  will not be\nenforced.  Example 2 (enforcement gets replaced):\n   organizations/foo  has a  Policy  with:\n    {enforced: false}\n   projects/bar  has a  Policy  with:\n    {enforced: true}\nThe constraint at  organizations/foo  is not enforced.\nThe constraint at  projects/bar  is enforced.  Example 3 (RestoreDefault):\n   organizations/foo  has a  Policy  with:\n    {enforced: true}\n   projects/bar  has a  Policy  with:\n    {RestoreDefault: {}}\nThe constraint at  organizations/foo  is enforced.\nThe constraint at  projects/bar  is not enforced, because constraint_default  for the  Constraint  is  ALLOW .      ..    constraint=amet    The name of the  Constraint  the  Policy  is configuring, for example,\n     constraints/serviceuser.services .  Immutable after creation.\n*  etag=no \n    - An opaque tag indicating the current version of the  Policy , used for\nconcurrency control.  When the  Policy  is returned from either a  GetPolicy  or a ListOrgPolicy  request, this  etag  indicates the version of the current Policy  to use when executing a read-modify-write loop.  When the  Policy  is returned from a  GetEffectivePolicy  request, the etag  will be unset.  When the  Policy  is used in a  SetOrgPolicy  method, use the  etag  value\nthat was returned from a  GetOrgPolicy  request as part of a\nread-modify-write loop for concurrency control. Not setting the  etag in a SetOrgPolicy  request will result in an unconditional write of the Policy .   list-policy    all-values=labore \n    - The policy all_values state.   allowed-values=eirmod \n    - List of values allowed  at this resource. Can only be set if no values\nare set for  denied_values  and  all_values  is set to ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED .\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.   denied-values=dolore \n    - List of values denied at this resource. Can only be set if no values are\nset for  allowed_values  and  all_values  is set to ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED .\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.   inherit-from-parent=true \n    - Determines the inheritance behavior for this  Policy .  By default, a  ListPolicy  set at a resource supercedes any  Policy  set\nanywhere up the resource hierarchy. However, if  inherit_from_parent  is\nset to  true , then the values from the effective  Policy  of the parent\nresource are inherited, meaning the values set in this  Policy  are\nadded to the values inherited up the hierarchy.  Setting  Policy  hierarchies that inherit both allowed values and denied\nvalues isn t recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration\nsimple and understandable. However, it is possible to set a  Policy  with allowed_values  set that inherits a  Policy  with  denied_values  set.\nIn this case, the values that are allowed must be in  allowed_values  and\nnot present in  denied_values .  For example, suppose you have a  Constraint  constraints/serviceuser.services , which has a  constraint_type  of list_constraint , and with  constraint_default  set to  ALLOW .\nSuppose that at the Organization level, a  Policy  is applied that\nrestricts the allowed API activations to { E1 ,  E2 }. Then, if a Policy  is applied to a project below the Organization that has inherit_from_parent  set to  false  and field all_values set to DENY,\nthen an attempt to activate any API will be denied.  The following examples demonstrate different possible layerings:  Example 1 (no inherited values):\n   organizations/foo  has a  Policy  with values:\n    {allowed_values: \u201cE1\u201d allowed_values:\u201dE2\u201d}\n   projects/bar  has  inherit_from_parent   false  and values:\n    {allowed_values:  E3  allowed_values:  E4 }\nThe accepted values at  organizations/foo  are  E1 ,  E2 .\nThe accepted values at  projects/bar  are  E3 , and  E4 .  Example 2 (inherited values):\n   organizations/foo  has a  Policy  with values:\n    {allowed_values: \u201cE1\u201d allowed_values:\u201dE2\u201d}\n   projects/bar  has a  Policy  with values:\n    {value: \u201cE3\u201d value: \u201dE4\u201d inherit_from_parent: true}\nThe accepted values at  organizations/foo  are  E1 ,  E2 .\nThe accepted values at  projects/bar  are  E1 ,  E2 ,  E3 , and  E4 .  Example 3 (inheriting both allowed and denied values):\n   organizations/foo  has a  Policy  with values:\n    {allowed_values:  E1  allowed_values:  E2 }\n   projects/bar  has a  Policy  with:\n    {denied_values:  E1 }\nThe accepted values at  organizations/foo  are  E1 ,  E2 .\nThe value accepted at  projects/bar  is  E2 .  Example 4 (RestoreDefault):\n   organizations/foo  has a  Policy  with values:\n    {allowed_values: \u201cE1\u201d allowed_values:\u201dE2\u201d}\n   projects/bar  has a  Policy  with values:\n    {RestoreDefault: {}}\nThe accepted values at  organizations/foo  are  E1 ,  E2 .\nThe accepted values at  projects/bar  are either all or none depending on\nthe value of  constraint_default  (if  ALLOW , all; if DENY , none).  Example 5 (no policy inherits parent policy):\n   organizations/foo  has no  Policy  set.\n   projects/bar  has no  Policy  set.\nThe accepted values at both levels are either all or none depending on\nthe value of  constraint_default  (if  ALLOW , all; if DENY , none).  Example 6 (ListConstraint allowing all):\n   organizations/foo  has a  Policy  with values:\n    {allowed_values: \u201cE1\u201d allowed_values: \u201dE2\u201d}\n   projects/bar  has a  Policy  with:\n    {all: ALLOW}\nThe accepted values at  organizations/foo  are  E1 , E2 .\nAny value is accepted at projects/bar`.  Example 7 (ListConstraint allowing none):\n   organizations/foo  has a  Policy  with values:\n    {allowed_values: \u201cE1\u201d allowed_values: \u201dE2\u201d}\n   projects/bar  has a  Policy  with:\n    {all: DENY}\nThe accepted values at  organizations/foo  are  E1 , E2 .\nNo value is accepted at projects/bar .\n* suggested-value=aliquyam - Optional.

The following rules apply:   The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the  .  character. Fields can be nested such as in  -r f.s.o  .  The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. . Each additional  .  moves it up one additional level. E.g.  ...  would go three levels up.",

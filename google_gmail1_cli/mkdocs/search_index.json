The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/gmail1-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/gmail1-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \ngmail\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \ngmail1 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

The special value me can be used to indicate the authenticated user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired Request Value\n\n\nThe request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nDraft:\n  id: string\n  message:\n    history-id: string\n    id: string\n    internal-date: string\n    label-ids: [string]\n    payload:\n      body:\n        attachment-id: string\n        data: string\n        size: integer\n      filename: string\n      mime-type: string\n      part-id: string\n    raw: string\n    size-estimate: integer\n    snippet: string\n    thread-id: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .    id=eirmod\n\n\nThe immutable ID of the draft.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmessage    history-id=sit\n\n\nThe ID of the last history record that modified this message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid=stet\n\n\nThe immutable ID of the message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninternal-date=sed\n\n\nThe internal message creation timestamp (epoch ms), which determines ordering in the inbox. For normal SMTP-received email, this represents the time the message was originally accepted by Google, which is more reliable than the Date header. However, for API-migrated mail, it can be configured by client to be based on the Date header.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlabel-ids=et\n\n\nList of IDs of labels applied to this message.\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npayload.body    attachment-id=dolores\n\n\nWhen present, contains the ID of an external attachment that can be retrieved in a separate messages.attachments.get request. When not present, the entire content of the message part body is contained in the data field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndata=kasd\n\n\nThe body data of a MIME message part. May be empty for MIME container types that have no message body or when the body data is sent as a separate attachment. An attachment ID is present if the body data is contained in a separate attachment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsize=79\n\n\n\n\nTotal number of bytes in the body of the message part.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    filename=takimata\n\n\n\n\nThe filename of the attachment. Only present if this message part represents an attachment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmime-type=justo\n\n\nThe MIME type of the message part.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npart-id=amet.\n\n\n\n\nThe immutable ID of the message part.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    raw=erat\n\n\n\n\nThe entire email message in an RFC 2822 formatted and base64url encoded string. Returned in messages.get and drafts.get responses when the format=RAW parameter is supplied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsize-estimate=66\n\n\nEstimated size in bytes of the message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsnippet=sea\n\n\nA short part of the message text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthread-id=nonumy\n\n\nThe ID of the thread the message belongs to. To add a message or draft to a thread, the following criteria must be met: \n\n\nThe requested threadId must be specified on the Message or Draft.Message you supply with your request. \n\n\nThe References and In-Reply-To headers must be set in compliance with the RFC 2822 standard. \n\n\nThe Subject headers must match.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.  For example, a structure like this:  Draft:\n  id: string\n  message:\n    history-id: string\n    id: string\n    internal-date: string\n    label-ids: [string]\n    payload:\n      body:\n        attachment-id: string\n        data: string\n        size: integer\n      filename: string\n      mime-type: string\n      part-id: string\n    raw: string\n    size-estimate: integer\n    snippet: string\n    thread-id: string  can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.   -r .    id=eirmod  The immutable ID of the draft.    message    history-id=sit  The ID of the last history record that modified this message.    id=stet  The immutable ID of the message.    internal-date=sed  The internal message creation timestamp (epoch ms), which determines ordering in the inbox. For normal SMTP-received email, this represents the time the message was originally accepted by Google, which is more reliable than the Date header. However, for API-migrated mail, it can be configured by client to be based on the Date header.    label-ids=et  List of IDs of labels applied to this message.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    payload.body    attachment-id=dolores  When present, contains the ID of an external attachment that can be retrieved in a separate messages.attachments.get request. When not present, the entire content of the message part body is contained in the data field.    data=kasd  The body data of a MIME message part. May be empty for MIME container types that have no message body or when the body data is sent as a separate attachment. An attachment ID is present if the body data is contained in a separate attachment.     size=79   Total number of bytes in the body of the message part.     ..    filename=takimata   The filename of the attachment. Only present if this message part represents an attachment.    mime-type=justo  The MIME type of the message part.     part-id=amet.   The immutable ID of the message part.     ..    raw=erat   The entire email message in an RFC 2822 formatted and base64url encoded string. Returned in messages.get and drafts.get responses when the format=RAW parameter is supplied.    size-estimate=66  Estimated size in bytes of the message.    snippet=sea  A short part of the message text.    thread-id=nonumy  The ID of the thread the message belongs to. To add a message or draft to a thread, the following criteria must be met:   The requested threadId must be specified on the Message or Draft.Message you supply with your request.   The References and In-Reply-To headers must be set in compliance with the RFC 2822 standard.   The Subject headers must match.       About Cursors  The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:   The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the  .  character. Fields can be nested such as in  -r f.s.o  .  The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. . Each additional  .  moves it up one additional level. E.g.  ...  would go three levels up.",

For example, a structure like this:  Draft:\n  id: string\n  message:\n    history-id: string\n    id: string\n    internal-date: string\n    label-ids: [string]\n    payload:\n      body:\n        attachment-id: string\n        data: string\n        size: integer\n      filename: string\n      mime-type: string\n      part-id: string\n    raw: string\n    size-estimate: integer\n    snippet: string\n    thread-id: string  can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.   -r .    id=aliquyam  The immutable ID of the draft.    message    history-id=sea  The ID of the last history record that modified this message.    id=lorem  The immutable ID of the message.    internal-date=eos  The internal message creation timestamp (epoch ms), which determines ordering in the inbox. For normal SMTP-received email, this represents the time the message was originally accepted by Google, which is more reliable than the Date header. However, for API-migrated mail, it can be configured by client to be based on the Date header.    label-ids=erat  List of IDs of labels applied to this message.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    payload.body    attachment-id=sadipscing  When present, contains the ID of an external attachment that can be retrieved in a separate messages.attachments.get request. When not present, the entire content of the message part body is contained in the data field.    data=dolor  The body data of a MIME message part. May be empty for MIME container types that have no message body or when the body data is sent as a separate attachment. An attachment ID is present if the body data is contained in a separate attachment.     size=62   Total number of bytes in the body of the message part.     ..    filename=elitr   The filename of the attachment. Only present if this message part represents an attachment.    mime-type=amet  The MIME type of the message part.     part-id=no   The immutable ID of the message part.     ..    raw=labore   The entire email message in an RFC 2822 formatted and base64url encoded string. Returned in messages.get and drafts.get responses when the format=RAW parameter is supplied.    size-estimate=62  Estimated size in bytes of the message.    snippet=dolore  A short part of the message text.    thread-id=invidunt  The ID of the thread the message belongs to. To add a message or draft to a thread, the following criteria must be met:   The requested threadId must be specified on the Message or Draft.Message you supply with your request.   The References and In-Reply-To headers must be set in compliance with the RFC 2822 standard.   The Subject headers must match.       About Cursors  The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:   The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the  .  character. Fields can be nested such as in  -r f.s.o  .  The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. . Each additional  .  moves it up one additional level. E.g.  ...  would go three levels up.",

For example, a structure like this:  Label:\n  id: string\n  label-list-visibility: string\n  message-list-visibility: string\n  messages-total: integer\n  messages-unread: integer\n  name: string\n  threads-total: integer\n  threads-unread: integer\n  type: string  can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.   -r .    id=aliquyam  The immutable ID of the label.    label-list-visibility=accusam  The visibility of the label in the label list in the Gmail web interface.    message-list-visibility=lorem  The visibility of the label in the message list in the Gmail web interface.    messages-total=92  The total number of messages with the label.    messages-unread=80  The number of unread messages with the label.    name=duo  The display name of the label.    threads-total=80  The total number of threads with the label.    threads-unread=61  The number of unread threads with the label.    type=sanctus  The owner type for the label. User labels are created by the user and can be modified and deleted by the user and can be applied to any message or thread. System labels are internally created and cannot be added, modified, or deleted. System labels may be able to be applied to or removed from messages and threads under some circumstances but this is not guaranteed. For example, users can apply and remove the INBOX and UNREAD labels from messages and threads, but cannot apply or remove the DRAFTS or SENT labels from messages or threads.     About Cursors  The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:   The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the  .  character. Fields can be nested such as in  -r f.s.o  .  The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. . Each additional  .  moves it up one additional level. E.g.  ...  would go three levels up.",

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level.

This topic name  must  already exist in Cloud Pub/Sub and you  must  have already granted gmail  publish  permission on it. For example,  projects/my-project-identifier/topics/my-topic-name  (using the Cloud Pub/Sub  v1  topic naming format).  Note that the  my-project-identifier  portion must exactly match your Google developer project id (the one executing this watch request).      About Cursors  The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:   The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the  .  character. Fields can be nested such as in  -r f.s.o  .  The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. . Each additional  .  moves it up one additional level. E.g.  ...  would go three levels up.",

No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/people1-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \npeople\n API \nwas enabled for it.

This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \npeople1 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nCreateContactGroupRequest:\n  contact-group:\n    etag: string\n    formatted-name: string\n    group-type: string\n    member-count: integer\n    member-resource-names: [string]\n    metadata:\n      deleted: boolean\n      update-time: string\n    name: string\n    resource-name: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .contact-group    etag=eirmod\n\n\nThe \nHTTP entity tag\n of the\n    resource. Used for web cache validation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nformatted-name=sit\n\n\nThe read-only name translated and formatted in the viewer\ns account locale\n    or the \nAccept-Language\n HTTP header locale for system groups names.\n    Group names set by the owner are the same as name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngroup-type=stet\n\n\nThe read-only contact group type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmember-count=59\n\n\nThe total number of contacts in the group irrespective of max members in\n    specified in the request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmember-resource-names=et\n\n\nThe list of contact person resource names that are members of the contact\n    group. The field is not populated for LIST requests and can only be updated\n    through the\n    \nModifyContactGroupMembers\n.\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmetadata    deleted=true\n\n\nTrue if the contact group resource has been deleted. Populated only for\n    \nListContactGroups\n requests\n    that include a sync token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nupdate-time=kasd\n\n\n\n\nThe time the group was last updated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    name=accusam\n\n\n\n\nThe contact group name set by the group owner or a system provided name\n    for system groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nresource-name=takimata\n\n\nThe resource name for the contact group, assigned by the server. An ASCII\n    string, in the form of \ncontactGroups/\nvar\ncontact_group_id\n/var\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p bearer-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth bearer token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nPerson:\n  age-range: string\n  etag: string\n  metadata:\n    deleted: boolean\n    linked-people-resource-names: [string]\n    object-type: string\n    previous-resource-names: [string]\n  resource-name: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call.

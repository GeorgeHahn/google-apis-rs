You can change the directory used to store configuration with the \n--config-dir\n flag on a per-invocation basis.\n\n\nMore information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMost APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the \nscope\n determines the \nset of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/dialogflow2-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/dialogflow2-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \ndialogflow\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \ndialogflow2 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

The project of this agent.\n    Format: \nprojects/\nlt;Project ID\ngt;\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired Request Value\n\n\nThe request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nGoogleCloudDialogflowV2Agent:\n  api-version: string\n  avatar-uri: string\n  classification-threshold: number\n  default-language-code: string\n  description: string\n  display-name: string\n  enable-logging: boolean\n  match-mode: string\n  parent: string\n  supported-language-codes: [string]\n  tier: string\n  time-zone: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .    api-version=eirmod\n\n\nOptional. API version displayed in Dialogflow console. If not specified,\n    V2 API is assumed. Clients are free to query different service endpoints\n    for different API versions. However, bots connectors and webhook calls will\n    follow the specified API version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\navatar-uri=sit\n\n\nOptional. The URI of the agent\ns avatar.\n    Avatars are used throughout the Dialogflow console and in the self-hosted\n    \nWeb\n    Demo\n\n    integration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclassification-threshold=0.365848359249\n\n\nOptional. To filter out false positive results and still get variety in\n    matched natural language inputs for your agent, you can tune the machine\n    learning classification threshold. If the returned score value is less than\n    the threshold value, then a fallback intent will be triggered or, if there\n    are no fallback intents defined, no intent will be triggered. The score\n    values range from 0.0 (completely uncertain) to 1.0 (completely certain).\n    If set to 0.0, the default of 0.3 is used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndefault-language-code=sed\n\n\nRequired. The default language of the agent as a language tag. See\n    \nLanguage\n    Support\n\n    for a list of the currently supported language codes. This field cannot be\n    set by the \nUpdate\n method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndescription=et\n\n\nOptional. The description of this agent.\n    The maximum length is 500 characters. If exceeded, the request is rejected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndisplay-name=dolores\n\n\nRequired. The name of this agent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenable-logging=false\n\n\nOptional. Determines whether this agent should log conversation queries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmatch-mode=accusam\n\n\nOptional. Determines how intents are detected from user queries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nparent=takimata\n\n\nRequired. The project of this agent.\n    Format: \nprojects/\nlt;Project ID\ngt;\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsupported-language-codes=justo\n\n\nOptional. The list of all languages supported by this agent (except for the\n    \ndefault_language_code\n).\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntier=amet.\n\n\nOptional. The agent tier. If not specified, TIER_STANDARD is assumed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntime-zone=erat\n\n\nRequired. The time zone of this agent from the\n    \ntime zone database\n, e.g.,\n    America/New_York, Europe/Paris.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nGoogleCloudDialogflowV2BatchDeleteIntentsRequest:\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nGoogleCloudDialogflowV2Context:\n  lifespan-count: integer\n  name: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.   -r .    input-audio=lorem  Optional. The natural language speech audio to be processed. This field\n    should be populated iff  query_input  is set to an input audio config.\n    A single request can contain up to 1 minute of speech audio data.    output-audio-config    audio-encoding=gubergren  Required. Audio encoding of the synthesized audio content.    sample-rate-hertz=81  Optional. The synthesis sample rate (in hertz) for this audio. If not\n    provided, then the synthesizer will use the default sample rate based on\n    the audio encoding. If this is different from the voice s natural sample\n    rate, then the synthesizer will honor this request by converting to the\n    desired sample rate (which might result in worse audio quality).    synthesize-speech-config    effects-profile-id=sit  Optional. An identifier which selects  audio effects  profiles that are\n    applied on (post synthesized) text to speech. Effects are applied on top of\n    each other in the order they are given.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    pitch=0.752180990981  Optional. Speaking pitch, in the range [-20.0, 20.0]. 20 means increase 20\n    semitones from the original pitch. -20 means decrease 20 semitones from the\n    original pitch.    speaking-rate=0.728870793678  Optional. Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal\n    native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and\n    0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any\n    other values   0.25 or   4.0 will return an error.    voice    name=rebum.  Optional. The name of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a\n    voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and gender.     ssml-gender=consetetur   Optional. The preferred gender of the voice. If not set, the service will\n    choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and\n    name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement. If a\n    voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer should\n    substitute a voice with a different gender rather than failing the request.     ..    volume-gain-db=0.568975580071   Optional. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the\n    specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of\n    0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB)\n    will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal\n    amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the\n    amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. We strongly recommend not\n    to exceed +10 (dB) as there s usually no effective increase in loudness for\n    any value greater than that.     ...query-input.audio-config    audio-encoding=vero   Required. Audio encoding of the audio content to process.    language-code=sadipscing  Required. The language of the supplied audio. Dialogflow does not do\n    translations. See  Language\n    Support \n    for a list of the currently supported language codes. Note that queries in\n    the same session do not necessarily need to specify the same language.    model-variant=invidunt  Optional. Which variant of the Speech model to use.     phrase-hints=consetetur    Optional. A list of strings containing words and phrases that the speech\n    recognizer should recognize with higher likelihood.  See  the Cloud Speech\ndocumentation \nfor more details.\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n*  sample-rate-hertz=17 \n    - Required. Sample rate (in Hertz) of the audio content sent in the query.\nRefer to Cloud Speech API\ndocumentation  for\nmore details.\n*  single-utterance=true \n    - Optional. If  false  (default), recognition does not cease until the\nclient closes the stream.\nIf  true , the recognizer will detect a single spoken utterance in input\naudio. Recognition ceases when it detects the audio s voice has\nstopped or paused. In this case, once a detected intent is received, the\nclient should close the stream and start a new request with a new stream as\nneeded.\nNote: This setting is relevant only for streaming methods.\nNote: When specified, InputAudioConfig.single_utterance takes precedence\nover StreamingDetectIntentRequest.single_utterance.      ..event    language-code=aliquyam   Required. The language of this query. See  Language\n    Support \n    for a list of the currently supported language codes. Note that queries in\n    the same session do not necessarily need to specify the same language.     name=lorem   Required. The unique identifier of the event.     ..text    language-code=et   Required. The language of this conversational query. See  Language\n    Support \n    for a list of the currently supported language codes. Note that queries in\n    the same session do not necessarily need to specify the same language.     text=clita   Required. The UTF-8 encoded natural language text to be processed.\n    Text length must not exceed 256 characters.     ...query-params.geo-location    latitude=0.55453533791   The latitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-90.0, +90.0].     longitude=0.427055674413   The longitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-180.0, +180.0].     ..    reset-contexts=true   Optional. Specifies whether to delete all contexts in the current session\n    before the new ones are activated.     sentiment-analysis-request-config    analyze-query-text-sentiment=true   Optional. Instructs the service to perform sentiment analysis on\n     query_text . If not provided, sentiment analysis is not performed on\n     query_text .     ..    time-zone=sanctus   Optional. The time zone of this conversational query from the\n     time zone database , e.g.,\n    America/New_York, Europe/Paris. If not provided, the time zone specified in\n    agent settings is used.",

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nGoogleCloudDialogflowV2SessionEntityType:\n  entity-override-mode: string\n  name: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .    entity-override-mode=labore\n\n\nRequired.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call.

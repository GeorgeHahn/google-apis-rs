You can change the directory used to store configuration with the \n--config-dir\n flag on a per-invocation basis.\n\n\nMore information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMost APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the \nscope\n determines the \nset of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/cloudiot1-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/cloudiot1-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \ncloudiot\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \ncloudiot1 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

If this field is not present, the device has\n    not yet acknowledged that it received this version. Note that when\n    the config was sent to the device, many config versions may have been\n    available in Cloud IoT Core while the device was disconnected, and on\n    connection, only the latest version is sent to the device. Some\n    versions may never be sent to the device, and therefore are never\n    acknowledged. This timestamp is set by Cloud IoT Core.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nversion=justo\n\n\n\n\n[Output only] The version of this update. The version number is assigned by\n    the server, and is always greater than 0 after device creation. The\n    version must be 0 on the \nCreateDevice\n request if a \nconfig\n is\n    specified; the response of \nCreateDevice\n will always have a value of 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    id=amet.\n\n\n\n\nThe user-defined device identifier.

This metadata is not\n    interpreted or indexed by Cloud IoT Core. It can be used to add contextual\n    information for the device.\n\n\nKeys must conform to the regular expression [a-zA-Z0-9-_]+ and be less than\n128 bytes in length.\n\n\nValues are free-form strings. Each value must be less than or equal to 32\nKB in size.\n\n\nThe total size of all keys and values must be less than 256 KB, and the\nmaximum number of key-value pairs is 500.\n    - the value will be associated with the given \nkey\n\n\n \nname=no\n\n    - The resource path name.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p bearer-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth bearer token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.   -r .    blocked=true  If a device is blocked, connections or requests from this device will fail.\n    Can be used to temporarily prevent the device from connecting if, for\n    example, the sensor is generating bad data and needs maintenance.    config    binary-data=kasd  The device configuration data.    cloud-update-time=accusam  [Output only] The time at which this configuration version was updated in\n    Cloud IoT Core. This timestamp is set by the server.    device-ack-time=takimata  [Output only] The time at which Cloud IoT Core received the\n    acknowledgment from the device, indicating that the device has received\n    this configuration version. If this field is not present, the device has\n    not yet acknowledged that it received this version. Note that when\n    the config was sent to the device, many config versions may have been\n    available in Cloud IoT Core while the device was disconnected, and on\n    connection, only the latest version is sent to the device. Some\n    versions may never be sent to the device, and therefore are never\n    acknowledged. This timestamp is set by Cloud IoT Core.     version=justo   [Output only] The version of this update. The version number is assigned by\n    the server, and is always greater than 0 after device creation. The\n    version must be 0 on the  CreateDevice  request if a  config  is\n    specified; the response of  CreateDevice  will always have a value of 1.     ..    id=amet.   The user-defined device identifier. The device ID must be unique\n    within a device registry.    last-config-ack-time=erat  [Output only] The last time a cloud-to-device config version acknowledgment\n    was received from the device. This field is only for configurations\n    sent through MQTT.    last-config-send-time=labore  [Output only] The last time a cloud-to-device config version was sent to\n    the device.    last-error-status    code=92  The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.     message=nonumy   A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any\n    user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the\n    google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.     ..    last-error-time=dolores   [Output only] The time the most recent error occurred, such as a failure to\n    publish to Cloud Pub/Sub. This field is the timestamp of\n     last_error_status .    last-event-time=gubergren  [Output only] The last time a telemetry event was received. Timestamps are\n    periodically collected and written to storage; they may be stale by a few\n    minutes.    last-heartbeat-time=sadipscing  [Output only] The last time a heartbeat was received. Timestamps are\n    periodically collected and written to storage; they may be stale by a few\n    minutes. This field is only for devices connecting through MQTT.    last-state-time=aliquyam  [Output only] The last time a state event was received. Timestamps are\n    periodically collected and written to storage; they may be stale by a few\n    minutes.    metadata=key=ea   The metadata key-value pairs assigned to the device. This metadata is not\n    interpreted or indexed by Cloud IoT Core. It can be used to add contextual\n    information for the device.  Keys must conform to the regular expression [a-zA-Z0-9-_]+ and be less than\n128 bytes in length.  Values are free-form strings. Each value must be less than or equal to 32\nKB in size.  The total size of all keys and values must be less than 256 KB, and the\nmaximum number of key-value pairs is 500.\n    - the value will be associated with the given  key    name=no \n    - The resource path name. For example, projects/p1/locations/us-central1/registries/registry0/devices/dev0  or projects/p1/locations/us-central1/registries/registry0/devices/{num_id} .\nWhen  name  is populated as a response from the service, it always ends\nin the device numeric ID.   num-id=justo \n    - [Output only] A server-defined unique numeric ID for the device. This is a\nmore compact way to identify devices, and it is globally unique.   state    binary-data=justo \n    - The device state data.   update-time=et \n    - [Output only] The time at which this state version was updated in Cloud\nIoT Core.",

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call.

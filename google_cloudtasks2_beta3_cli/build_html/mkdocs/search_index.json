You can change the directory used to store configuration with the \n--config-dir\n flag on a per-invocation basis.\n\n\nMore information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMost APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the \nscope\n determines the \nset of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/cloudtasks2-beta3-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/cloudtasks2-beta3-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \ncloudtasks\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \ncloudtasks2-beta3 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

The max burst size.\n\n\nMax burst size limits how fast tasks in queue are processed when\nmany tasks are in the queue and the rate is high. This field\nallows the queue to have a high rate so processing starts shortly\nafter a task is enqueued, but still limits resource usage when\nmany tasks are enqueued in a short period of time.\n\n\nThe \ntoken bucket\n\nalgorithm is used to control the rate of task dispatches. Each\nqueue has a token bucket that holds tokens, up to the maximum\nspecified by \nmax_burst_size\n. Each time a task is dispatched, a\ntoken is removed from the bucket. Tasks will be dispatched until\nthe queue\ns bucket runs out of tokens. The bucket will be\ncontinuously refilled with new tokens based on\nmax_dispatches_per_second.\n\n\nCloud Tasks will pick the value of \nmax_burst_size\n based on the\nvalue of\nmax_dispatches_per_second.\n\n\nFor App Engine queues that were created or updated using\n\nqueue.yaml/xml\n, \nmax_burst_size\n is equal to\n\nbucket_size\n.\nSince \nmax_burst_size\n is output only, if\nUpdateQueue is called on a queue\ncreated by \nqueue.yaml/xml\n, \nmax_burst_size\n will be reset based\non the value of\nmax_dispatches_per_second,\nregardless of whether\nmax_dispatches_per_second\nis updated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmax-concurrent-dispatches=80\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe maximum number of concurrent tasks that Cloud Tasks allows\n    to be dispatched for this queue.

The retry interval will double three times, and then\nincrease linearly by 2^3 * 10s.  Finally, the task will retry at\nintervals of max_backoff until the\ntask has been attempted max_attempts\ntimes. Thus, the requests will retry at 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s, 160s,\n240s, 300s, 300s, ....\n\n\nIf unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the\ndefault.\n\n\nThis field has the same meaning as\n\nmax_doublings in queue.yaml/xml\n.\n\n \nmax-retry-duration=lorem\n\n    - If positive, \nmax_retry_duration\n specifies the time limit for\nretrying a failed task, measured from when the task was first\nattempted. Once \nmax_retry_duration\n time has passed \nand* the\ntask has been attempted max_attempts\ntimes, no further attempts will be made and the task will be\ndeleted.\n\n\nIf zero, then the task age is unlimited.\n\n\nIf unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the\ndefault.\n\n\nmax_retry_duration\n will be truncated to the nearest second.\n\n\nThis field has the same meaning as\n\ntask_age_limit in queue.yaml/xml\n.\n* \nmin-backoff=et\n\n    - A task will be scheduled for retry between\nmin_backoff and\nmax_backoff duration after it fails,\nif the queue\ns RetryConfig specifies that the task should be\nretried.\n\n\nIf unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the\ndefault.\n\n\nmin_backoff\n will be truncated to the nearest second.\n\n\nThis field has the same meaning as\n\nmin_backoff_seconds in queue.yaml/xml\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    state=duo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput only. The state of the queue.\n\n\nstate\n can only be changed by called\nPauseQueue,\nResumeQueue, or uploading\n\nqueue.yaml/xml\n.\nUpdateQueue cannot be used to change \nstate\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call.

For some queues or tasks which were created using the App Engine\nTask Queue API, host is not parsable\ninto service,\nversion, and\ninstance. For example, some tasks\nwhich were created using the App Engine SDK use a custom domain\nname; custom domains are not parsed by Cloud Tasks. If\nhost is not parsable, then\nservice,\nversion, and\ninstance are the empty string.\n*  version=aliquyam \n    - App version.  By default, the task is sent to the version which is the default\nversion when the task is attempted.  For some queues or tasks which were created using the App Engine\nTask Queue API, host is not parsable\ninto service,\nversion, and\ninstance. For example, some tasks\nwhich were created using the App Engine SDK use a custom domain\nname; custom domains are not parsed by Cloud Tasks.

The queue name.  The queue name must have the following format: projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID   PROJECT_ID  can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]),\n   hyphens (-), colons (:), or periods (.).\n   For more information, see\n    Identifying projects  LOCATION_ID  is the canonical ID for the queue s location.\n   The list of available locations can be obtained by calling\n   ListLocations.\n   For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/.  QUEUE_ID  can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), or\n  hyphens (-). The maximum length is 100 characters.  purge-time=no  Output only. The last time this queue was purged.     All tasks that were created before this time\nwere purged.  A queue can be purged using PurgeQueue, the App Engine Task Queue SDK, or the Cloud Console .  Purge time will be truncated to the nearest microsecond. Purge\ntime will be unset if the queue has never been purged.\n*  rate-limits    max-burst-size=80 \n    - Output only. The max burst size.  Max burst size limits how fast tasks in queue are processed when\nmany tasks are in the queue and the rate is high. This field\nallows the queue to have a high rate so processing starts shortly\nafter a task is enqueued, but still limits resource usage when\nmany tasks are enqueued in a short period of time.  The  token bucket \nalgorithm is used to control the rate of task dispatches. Each\nqueue has a token bucket that holds tokens, up to the maximum\nspecified by  max_burst_size . Each time a task is dispatched, a\ntoken is removed from the bucket. Tasks will be dispatched until\nthe queue s bucket runs out of tokens. The bucket will be\ncontinuously refilled with new tokens based on\nmax_dispatches_per_second.  Cloud Tasks will pick the value of  max_burst_size  based on the\nvalue of\nmax_dispatches_per_second.  For App Engine queues that were created or updated using queue.yaml/xml ,  max_burst_size  is equal to bucket_size .\nSince  max_burst_size  is output only, if\nUpdateQueue is called on a queue\ncreated by  queue.yaml/xml ,  max_burst_size  will be reset based\non the value of\nmax_dispatches_per_second,\nregardless of whether\nmax_dispatches_per_second\nis updated.      max-concurrent-dispatches=80    The maximum number of concurrent tasks that Cloud Tasks allows\n    to be dispatched for this queue. After this threshold has been\n    reached, Cloud Tasks stops dispatching tasks until the number of\n    concurrent requests decreases.  If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the\ndefault.  The maximum allowed value is 5,000.  This field has the same meaning as max_concurrent_requests in queue.yaml/xml .\n*  max-dispatches-per-second=0.663748882844 \n    - The maximum rate at which tasks are dispatched from this queue.  If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the\ndefault.   For App Engine queues, the maximum allowed value\n  is 500.   This field has the same meaning as rate in queue.yaml/xml .      ..retry-config    max-attempts=84    Number of attempts per task.  Cloud Tasks will attempt the task  max_attempts  times (that is, if the\nfirst attempt fails, then there will be  max_attempts - 1  retries). Must\nbe  = -1.  If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the\ndefault.  -1 indicates unlimited attempts.  This field has the same meaning as task_retry_limit in queue.yaml/xml .\n*  max-backoff=diam \n    - A task will be scheduled for retry between\nmin_backoff and\nmax_backoff duration after it fails,\nif the queue s RetryConfig specifies that the task should be\nretried.  If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the\ndefault.  max_backoff  will be truncated to the nearest second.  This field has the same meaning as max_backoff_seconds in queue.yaml/xml .\n*  max-doublings=46 \n    - The time between retries will double  max_doublings  times.  A task s retry interval starts at\nmin_backoff, then doubles max_doublings  times, then increases linearly, and finally\nretries retries at intervals of\nmax_backoff up to\nmax_attempts times.  For example, if min_backoff is 10s,\nmax_backoff is 300s, and max_doublings  is 3, then the a task will first be retried in\n10s. The retry interval will double three times, and then\nincrease linearly by 2^3 * 10s.  Finally, the task will retry at\nintervals of max_backoff until the\ntask has been attempted max_attempts\ntimes. Thus, the requests will retry at 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s, 160s,\n240s, 300s, 300s, ....  If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the\ndefault.  This field has the same meaning as max_doublings in queue.yaml/xml .   max-retry-duration=lorem \n    - If positive,  max_retry_duration  specifies the time limit for\nretrying a failed task, measured from when the task was first\nattempted. Once  max_retry_duration  time has passed  and* the\ntask has been attempted max_attempts\ntimes, no further attempts will be made and the task will be\ndeleted.  If zero, then the task age is unlimited.  If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the\ndefault.  max_retry_duration  will be truncated to the nearest second.  This field has the same meaning as task_age_limit in queue.yaml/xml .\n*  min-backoff=et \n    - A task will be scheduled for retry between\nmin_backoff and\nmax_backoff duration after it fails,\nif the queue s RetryConfig specifies that the task should be\nretried.  If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the\ndefault.  min_backoff  will be truncated to the nearest second.  This field has the same meaning as min_backoff_seconds in queue.yaml/xml .      ..    state=duo    Output only.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nRunTaskRequest:\n  response-view: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly.

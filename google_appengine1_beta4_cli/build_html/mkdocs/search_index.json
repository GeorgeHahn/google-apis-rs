No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/appengine1-beta4-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \nappengine\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \nappengine1-beta4 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level.

May only be set on create requests; once created, is immutable.  the value will be associated with the given  key    health-check    check-interval=elitr  The interval between health checks.    disable-health-check=false  Whether to explicitly disable health checks for this instance.    healthy-threshold=41  The number of consecutive successful health checks before receiving traffic.    host=labore  The host header to send when performing an HTTP health check (e.g. myapp.appspot.com)    restart-threshold=62  The number of consecutive failed health checks before an instance is restarted.    timeout=dolore  The amount of time before the health check is considered failed.     unhealthy-threshold=64   The number of consecutive failed health checks before removing traffic.     ..    id=aliquyam   The relative name/path of the Version within the module. Example:  v1 . Version specifiers can contain lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens. It cannot begin with the prefix  ah-  and the names  default  and  latest  are reserved and cannot be used.    inbound-services=accusam  Before an application can receive email or XMPP messages, the application must be configured to enable the service.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    instance-class=lorem  The frontend instance class to use to run this app. Valid values are  [F1, F2, F4, F4_1G] . Default:  F1     manual-scaling    instances=92   The number of instances to assign to the module at the start. This number can later be altered by using the  Modules API   set_num_instances()  function.     ..    name=et   The full path to the Version resource in the API. Example:  apps/myapp/modules/default/versions/v1 . @OutputOnly    network    forwarded-ports=duo  A list of ports (or port pairs) to forward from the VM into the app container.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    instance-tag=et  A tag to apply to the VM instance during creation.     name=eirmod   The Google Compute Engine network where the VMs will be created. If not specified, or empty, the network named  default  will be used. (The short name should be specified, not the resource path.)     ..    nobuild-files-regex=sanctus   Go only. Files that match this pattern will not be built into the app. May only be set on create requests.    resources    cpu=0.790427604532  How many CPU cores an app version needs.    disk-gb=0.549609244211  How much disk size, in GB, an app version needs.     memory-gb=0.77599682643   How much memory, in GB, an app version needs.     ..    runtime=consetetur   The desired runtime. Values can include python27, java7, go, etc.    serving-status=ut  The current serving status of this version. Only  SERVING  versions will have instances created or billed for. If this field is unset when a version is created,  SERVING  status will be assumed. It is an error to explicitly set this field to  SERVING_STATUS_UNSPECIFIED .    threadsafe=true  If true, multiple requests can be dispatched to the app at once.    vm=false  Whether to deploy this app in a VM container.     About Cursors  The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:   The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the  .  character. Fields can be nested such as in  -r f.s.o  .  The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. . Each additional  .  moves it up one additional level. E.g.  ...  would go three levels up.",

For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level.

Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    instance-class=eirmod  The frontend instance class to use to run this app. Valid values are  [F1, F2, F4, F4_1G] . Default:  F1     manual-scaling    instances=55   The number of instances to assign to the module at the start. This number can later be altered by using the  Modules API   set_num_instances()  function.     ..    name=labore   The full path to the Version resource in the API. Example:  apps/myapp/modules/default/versions/v1 . @OutputOnly    network    forwarded-ports=sed  A list of ports (or port pairs) to forward from the VM into the app container.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    instance-tag=ea  A tag to apply to the VM instance during creation.     name=gubergren   The Google Compute Engine network where the VMs will be created. If not specified, or empty, the network named  default  will be used. (The short name should be specified, not the resource path.)     ..    nobuild-files-regex=aliquyam   Go only. Files that match this pattern will not be built into the app. May only be set on create requests.    resources    cpu=0.76272977112  How many CPU cores an app version needs.    disk-gb=0.624898723733  How much disk size, in GB, an app version needs.     memory-gb=0.417527511227   How much memory, in GB, an app version needs.     ..    runtime=labore   The desired runtime. Values can include python27, java7, go, etc.    serving-status=ipsum  The current serving status of this version. Only  SERVING  versions will have instances created or billed for. If this field is unset when a version is created,  SERVING  status will be assumed. It is an error to explicitly set this field to  SERVING_STATUS_UNSPECIFIED .    threadsafe=true  If true, multiple requests can be dispatched to the app at once.    vm=false  Whether to deploy this app in a VM container.     About Cursors  The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:   The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the  .  character. Fields can be nested such as in  -r f.s.o  .  The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. . Each additional  .  moves it up one additional level. E.g.  ...  would go three levels up.",

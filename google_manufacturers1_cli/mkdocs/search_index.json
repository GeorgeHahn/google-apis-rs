Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero.\n\n\nIf data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools.\n\n\nEverything else about the \nManufacturer Center\n API can be found at the\n\nofficial documentation site\n.\n\n\nInstallation and Source Code\n\n\nInstall the command-line interface with cargo using:\n\n\ncargo install google-manufacturers1-cli\n\n\n\n\nFind the source code \non github\n.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nThis documentation was generated from the \nManufacturer Center\n API at revision \n20161028\n. The CLI is at version \n1.0.0\n.\n\n\nmanufacturers1 [options]\n        accounts\n                products-get \nparent\n \nname\n [-p \nv\n]...

Defaults to\n            a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation.\n            [default: ~/.google-service-cli]\n  --debug\n            Output all server communication to standard error. `tx` and `rx` are placed\n            into the same stream.\n  --debug-auth\n            Output all communication related to authentication to standard error. `tx`\n            and `rx` are placed into the same stream.\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nThe program will store all persistent data in the \n~/.google-service-cli\n directory in \nJSON\n files prefixed with \nmanufacturers1-\n.  You can change the directory used to store configuration with the \n--config-dir\n flag on a per-invocation basis.\n\n\nMore information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMost APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the \nscope\n determines the \nset of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/manufacturers1-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/manufacturers1-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \nmanufacturers\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \nmanufacturers1 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

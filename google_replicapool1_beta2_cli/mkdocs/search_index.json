APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/replicapool1-beta2-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \nreplicapool\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \nreplicapool1-beta2 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

The value must be a valid RFC1035 name. Supported characters are lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens (-). Instances are named by appending a hyphen and a random four-character string to the base instance name.    creation-timestamp=sed  [Output only] The time the instance group manager was created, in RFC3339 text format.    current-size=16  [Output only] The number of instances that currently exist and are a part of this group. This includes instances that are starting but are not yet RUNNING, and instances that are in the process of being deleted or abandoned.    description=dolores  An optional textual description of the instance group manager.    fingerprint=kasd  [Output only] Fingerprint of the instance group manager. This field is used for optimistic locking. An up-to-date fingerprint must be provided in order to modify the Instance Group Manager resource.    group=accusam  [Output only] The full URL of the instance group created by the manager. This group contains all of the instances being managed, and cannot contain non-managed instances.    id=takimata  [Output only] A server-assigned unique identifier for the resource.    instance-template=justo  The full URL to an instance template from which all new instances will be created.    kind=amet.  [Output only] The resource type. Always replicapool#instanceGroupManager.    name=erat  The name of the instance group manager. Must be 1-63 characters long and comply with RFC1035. Supported characters include lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.    self-link=labore  [Output only] The fully qualified URL for this resource.    target-pools=sea  The full URL of all target pools to which new instances in the group are added. Updating the target pool values does not affect existing instances.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    target-size=11  [Output only] The number of instances that the manager is attempting to maintain.

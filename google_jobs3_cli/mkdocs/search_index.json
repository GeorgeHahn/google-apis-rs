APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/jobs3-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \njobs\n API \nwas enabled for it.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nCreateCompanyRequest:\n  company:\n    career-site-uri: string\n    derived-info:\n      headquarters-location:\n        lat-lng:\n          latitude: number\n          longitude: number\n        location-type: string\n        postal-address:\n          address-lines: [string]\n          administrative-area: string\n          language-code: string\n          locality: string\n          organization: string\n          postal-code: string\n          recipients: [string]\n          region-code: string\n          revision: integer\n          sorting-code: string\n          sublocality: string\n        radius-in-miles: number\n    display-name: string\n    eeo-text: string\n    external-id: string\n    headquarters-address: string\n    hiring-agency: boolean\n    image-uri: string\n    keyword-searchable-job-custom-attributes: [string]\n    name: string\n    size: string\n    suspended: boolean\n    website-uri: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-r .company    career-site-uri=eirmod\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional.\n\n\nThe URI to employer\ns career site or careers page on the employer\ns web\nsite, for example, \nhttps://careers.google.com\n.\n\n \nderived-info.headquarters-location.lat-lng    latitude=0.533265573605\n\n    - The latitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-90.0, +90.0].\n\n \nlongitude=0.365848359249\n\n    - The longitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-180.0, +180.0].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    location-type=sed\n\n\n\n\nThe type of a location, which corresponds to the address lines field of\n    PostalAddress. For example, \nDowntown, Atlanta, GA, USA\n has a type of\n    LocationType#NEIGHBORHOOD, and \nKansas City, KS, USA\n has a type of\n    LocationType#LOCALITY.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npostal-address    address-lines=et\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address.\n\n\nBecause values in address_lines do not have type information and may\nsometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g.\n\nAustin, TX\n), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of\naddress lines should be \nenvelope order\n for the country/region of the\naddress. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is\nused to make it explicit (e.g. \nja\n for large-to-small ordering and\n\nja-Latn\n or \nen\n for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of\nan address can be selected based on the language.\n\n\nThe minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists\nof a region_code with all remaining information placed in the\naddress_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very\napproximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be\nmade about any of the address components until it was at least\npartially resolved.\n\n\nCreating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and\nthen geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured\naddresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be\nlocalities or administrative areas).\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n \nadministrative-area=dolores\n\n    - Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal\naddresses of a country or region.\nFor example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture.\nSpecifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous\ncommunity (e.g. \nBarcelona\n and not \nCatalonia\n).\nMany countries don\nt use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g.\nin Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.\n\n \nlanguage-code=kasd\n\n    - Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if\nknown). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected\nto match one of the languages used in the address\n country/region, or their\ntransliterated equivalents.\nThis can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical\nto the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or\nother non-formatting related operations.\n\n\nIf this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a\npossibly incorrect default).\n\n\nExamples: \nzh-Hant\n, \nja\n, \nja-Latn\n, \nen\n.\n\n \nlocality=accusam\n\n    - Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address.\nExamples: US city, IT comune, UK post town.\nIn regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit\ninto this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines.\n\n \norganization=takimata\n\n    - Optional. The name of the organization at the address.\n\n \npostal-code=justo\n\n    - Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require\npostal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger\nadditional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip\nvalidation in the U.S.A.).\n\n \nrecipients=amet.\n\n    - Optional. The recipient at the address.\nThis field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information.\nFor example, it might contain \ncare of\n information.\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n \nregion-code=erat\n\n    - Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This\nis never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is\ncorrect. See http://cldr.unicode.org/ and\nhttp://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html\nfor details. Example: \nCH\n for Switzerland.\n\n \nrevision=66\n\n    - The schema revision of the \nPostalAddress\n. This must be set to 0, which is\nthe latest revision.\n\n\nAll new revisions \nmust\n be backward compatible with old revisions.\n\n \nsorting-code=sea\n\n    - Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used\nin most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like\n\nCEDEX\n, optionally followed by a number (e.g. \nCEDEX 7\n), or just a number\nalone, representing the \nsector code\n (Jamaica), \ndelivery area indicator\n\n(Malawi) or \npost office indicator\n (e.g. C\u00f4te d\nIvoire).\n\n \nsublocality=nonumy\n\n    - Optional. Sublocality of the address.\nFor example, this can be neighborhoods, boroughs, districts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    radius-in-miles=0.820437629783\n\n\n\n\nRadius in meters of the job location. This value is derived from the\n    location bounding box in which a circle with the specified radius\n    centered from LatLng coves the area associated with the job location.\n    For example, currently, \nMountain View, CA, USA\n has a radius of\n    6.17 miles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...    display-name=gubergren\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired.\n\n\nThe display name of the company, for example, \nGoogle, LLC\n.\n* \neeo-text=sadipscing\n\n    - Optional.\n\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity legal disclaimer text to be\nassociated with all jobs, and typically to be displayed in all\nroles.\n\n\nThe maximum number of allowed characters is 500.\n* \nexternal-id=aliquyam\n\n    - Required.\n\n\nClient side company identifier, used to uniquely identify the\ncompany.\n\n\nThe maximum number of allowed characters is 255.\n* \nheadquarters-address=ea\n\n    - Optional.\n\n\nThe street address of the company\ns main headquarters, which may be\ndifferent from the job location. The service attempts\nto geolocate the provided address, and populates a more specific\nlocation wherever possible in DerivedInfo.headquarters_location.\n* \nhiring-agency=false\n\n    - Optional.\n\n\nSet to true if it is the hiring agency that post jobs for other\nemployers.\n\n\nDefaults to false if not provided.\n* \nimage-uri=justo\n\n    - Optional.\n\n\nA URI that hosts the employer\ns company logo.\n* \nkeyword-searchable-job-custom-attributes=justo\n\n    - Optional.\n\n\nA list of keys of filterable Job.custom_attributes, whose\ncorresponding \nstring_values\n are used in keyword search. Jobs with\n\nstring_values\n under these specified field keys are returned if any\nof the values matches the search keyword. Custom field values with\nparenthesis, brackets and special symbols won\nt be properly searchable,\nand those keyword queries need to be surrounded by quotes.\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n* \nname=et\n\n    - Required during company update.\n\n\nThe resource name for a company. This is generated by the service when a\ncompany is created.\n\n\nThe format is \nprojects/{project_id}/companies/{company_id}\n, for example,\n\nprojects/api-test-project/companies/foo\n.\n* \nsize=et\n\n    - Optional.\n\n\nThe employer\ns company size.\n\n \nsuspended=true\n\n    - Output only. Indicates whether a company is flagged to be suspended from\npublic availability by the service when job content appears suspicious,\nabusive, or spammy.\n\n \nwebsite-uri=ipsum\n\n    - Optional.\n\n\nThe URI representing the company\ns primary web site or home page,\nfor example, \nhttps://www.google.com\n.\n\n\nThe maximum number of allowed characters is 255.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.    -r .company    career-site-uri=eirmod    Optional.  The URI to employer s career site or careers page on the employer s web\nsite, for example,  https://careers.google.com .   derived-info.headquarters-location.lat-lng    latitude=0.533265573605 \n    - The latitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-90.0, +90.0].   longitude=0.365848359249 \n    - The longitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-180.0, +180.0].      ..    location-type=sed   The type of a location, which corresponds to the address lines field of\n    PostalAddress. For example,  Downtown, Atlanta, GA, USA  has a type of\n    LocationType#NEIGHBORHOOD, and  Kansas City, KS, USA  has a type of\n    LocationType#LOCALITY.     postal-address    address-lines=et    Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address.  Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may\nsometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. Austin, TX ), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of\naddress lines should be  envelope order  for the country/region of the\naddress. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is\nused to make it explicit (e.g.  ja  for large-to-small ordering and ja-Latn  or  en  for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of\nan address can be selected based on the language.  The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists\nof a region_code with all remaining information placed in the\naddress_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very\napproximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be\nmade about any of the address components until it was at least\npartially resolved.  Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and\nthen geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured\naddresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be\nlocalities or administrative areas).\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.   administrative-area=dolores \n    - Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal\naddresses of a country or region.\nFor example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture.\nSpecifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous\ncommunity (e.g.  Barcelona  and not  Catalonia ).\nMany countries don t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g.\nin Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.   language-code=kasd \n    - Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if\nknown). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected\nto match one of the languages used in the address  country/region, or their\ntransliterated equivalents.\nThis can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical\nto the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or\nother non-formatting related operations.  If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a\npossibly incorrect default).  Examples:  zh-Hant ,  ja ,  ja-Latn ,  en .   locality=accusam \n    - Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address.\nExamples: US city, IT comune, UK post town.\nIn regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit\ninto this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines.   organization=takimata \n    - Optional. The name of the organization at the address.   postal-code=justo \n    - Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require\npostal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger\nadditional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip\nvalidation in the U.S.A.).   recipients=amet. \n    - Optional. The recipient at the address.\nThis field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information.\nFor example, it might contain  care of  information.\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.   region-code=erat \n    - Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This\nis never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is\ncorrect. See http://cldr.unicode.org/ and\nhttp://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html\nfor details. Example:  CH  for Switzerland.   revision=66 \n    - The schema revision of the  PostalAddress . This must be set to 0, which is\nthe latest revision.  All new revisions  must  be backward compatible with old revisions.   sorting-code=sea \n    - Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used\nin most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like CEDEX , optionally followed by a number (e.g.  CEDEX 7 ), or just a number\nalone, representing the  sector code  (Jamaica),  delivery area indicator \n(Malawi) or  post office indicator  (e.g. C\u00f4te d Ivoire).   sublocality=nonumy \n    - Optional. Sublocality of the address.\nFor example, this can be neighborhoods, boroughs, districts.      ..    radius-in-miles=0.820437629783   Radius in meters of the job location. This value is derived from the\n    location bounding box in which a circle with the specified radius\n    centered from LatLng coves the area associated with the job location.\n    For example, currently,  Mountain View, CA, USA  has a radius of\n    6.17 miles.     ...    display-name=gubergren    Required.  The display name of the company, for example,  Google, LLC .\n*  eeo-text=sadipscing \n    - Optional.  Equal Employment Opportunity legal disclaimer text to be\nassociated with all jobs, and typically to be displayed in all\nroles.  The maximum number of allowed characters is 500.\n*  external-id=aliquyam \n    - Required.  Client side company identifier, used to uniquely identify the\ncompany.  The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.\n*  headquarters-address=ea \n    - Optional.  The street address of the company s main headquarters, which may be\ndifferent from the job location. The service attempts\nto geolocate the provided address, and populates a more specific\nlocation wherever possible in DerivedInfo.headquarters_location.\n*  hiring-agency=false \n    - Optional.  Set to true if it is the hiring agency that post jobs for other\nemployers.  Defaults to false if not provided.\n*  image-uri=justo \n    - Optional.  A URI that hosts the employer s company logo.\n*  keyword-searchable-job-custom-attributes=justo \n    - Optional.  A list of keys of filterable Job.custom_attributes, whose\ncorresponding  string_values  are used in keyword search. Jobs with string_values  under these specified field keys are returned if any\nof the values matches the search keyword. Custom field values with\nparenthesis, brackets and special symbols won t be properly searchable,\nand those keyword queries need to be surrounded by quotes.\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n*  name=et \n    - Required during company update.  The resource name for a company. This is generated by the service when a\ncompany is created.  The format is  projects/{project_id}/companies/{company_id} , for example, projects/api-test-project/companies/foo .\n*  size=et \n    - Optional.  The employer s company size.   suspended=true \n    - Output only. Indicates whether a company is flagged to be suspended from\npublic availability by the service when job content appears suspicious,\nabusive, or spammy.   website-uri=ipsum \n    - Optional.  The URI representing the company s primary web site or home page,\nfor example,  https://www.google.com .  The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.",

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-r .company    career-site-uri=lorem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional.\n\n\nThe URI to employer\ns career site or careers page on the employer\ns web\nsite, for example, \nhttps://careers.google.com\n.\n\n \nderived-info.headquarters-location.lat-lng    latitude=0.795720263212\n\n    - The latitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-90.0, +90.0].\n\n \nlongitude=0.313727897996\n\n    - The longitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-180.0, +180.0].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    location-type=aliquyam\n\n\n\n\nThe type of a location, which corresponds to the address lines field of\n    PostalAddress. For example, \nDowntown, Atlanta, GA, USA\n has a type of\n    LocationType#NEIGHBORHOOD, and \nKansas City, KS, USA\n has a type of\n    LocationType#LOCALITY.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npostal-address    address-lines=sea\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address.\n\n\nBecause values in address_lines do not have type information and may\nsometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g.\n\nAustin, TX\n), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of\naddress lines should be \nenvelope order\n for the country/region of the\naddress. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is\nused to make it explicit (e.g. \nja\n for large-to-small ordering and\n\nja-Latn\n or \nen\n for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of\nan address can be selected based on the language.\n\n\nThe minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists\nof a region_code with all remaining information placed in the\naddress_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very\napproximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be\nmade about any of the address components until it was at least\npartially resolved.\n\n\nCreating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and\nthen geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured\naddresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be\nlocalities or administrative areas).\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n \nadministrative-area=lorem\n\n    - Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal\naddresses of a country or region.\nFor example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture.\nSpecifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous\ncommunity (e.g. \nBarcelona\n and not \nCatalonia\n).\nMany countries don\nt use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g.\nin Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.\n\n \nlanguage-code=eos\n\n    - Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if\nknown). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected\nto match one of the languages used in the address\n country/region, or their\ntransliterated equivalents.\nThis can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical\nto the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or\nother non-formatting related operations.\n\n\nIf this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a\npossibly incorrect default).\n\n\nExamples: \nzh-Hant\n, \nja\n, \nja-Latn\n, \nen\n.\n\n \nlocality=erat\n\n    - Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address.\nExamples: US city, IT comune, UK post town.\nIn regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit\ninto this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines.\n\n \norganization=sadipscing\n\n    - Optional. The name of the organization at the address.\n\n \npostal-code=dolor\n\n    - Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require\npostal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger\nadditional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip\nvalidation in the U.S.A.).\n\n \nrecipients=eirmod\n\n    - Optional. The recipient at the address.\nThis field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information.\nFor example, it might contain \ncare of\n information.\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n \nregion-code=elitr\n\n    - Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This\nis never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is\ncorrect. See http://cldr.unicode.org/ and\nhttp://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html\nfor details. Example: \nCH\n for Switzerland.\n\n \nrevision=4\n\n    - The schema revision of the \nPostalAddress\n. This must be set to 0, which is\nthe latest revision.\n\n\nAll new revisions \nmust\n be backward compatible with old revisions.\n\n \nsorting-code=no\n\n    - Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used\nin most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like\n\nCEDEX\n, optionally followed by a number (e.g. \nCEDEX 7\n), or just a number\nalone, representing the \nsector code\n (Jamaica), \ndelivery area indicator\n\n(Malawi) or \npost office indicator\n (e.g. C\u00f4te d\nIvoire).\n\n \nsublocality=labore\n\n    - Optional. Sublocality of the address.\nFor example, this can be neighborhoods, boroughs, districts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    radius-in-miles=0.61974554549\n\n\n\n\nRadius in meters of the job location. This value is derived from the\n    location bounding box in which a circle with the specified radius\n    centered from LatLng coves the area associated with the job location.\n    For example, currently, \nMountain View, CA, USA\n has a radius of\n    6.17 miles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...    display-name=dolore\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired.\n\n\nThe display name of the company, for example, \nGoogle, LLC\n.\n* \neeo-text=invidunt\n\n    - Optional.\n\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity legal disclaimer text to be\nassociated with all jobs, and typically to be displayed in all\nroles.\n\n\nThe maximum number of allowed characters is 500.\n* \nexternal-id=aliquyam\n\n    - Required.\n\n\nClient side company identifier, used to uniquely identify the\ncompany.\n\n\nThe maximum number of allowed characters is 255.\n* \nheadquarters-address=accusam\n\n    - Optional.\n\n\nThe street address of the company\ns main headquarters, which may be\ndifferent from the job location. The service attempts\nto geolocate the provided address, and populates a more specific\nlocation wherever possible in DerivedInfo.headquarters_location.\n* \nhiring-agency=false\n\n    - Optional.\n\n\nSet to true if it is the hiring agency that post jobs for other\nemployers.\n\n\nDefaults to false if not provided.\n* \nimage-uri=sea\n\n    - Optional.\n\n\nA URI that hosts the employer\ns company logo.\n* \nkeyword-searchable-job-custom-attributes=et\n\n    - Optional.\n\n\nA list of keys of filterable Job.custom_attributes, whose\ncorresponding \nstring_values\n are used in keyword search. Jobs with\n\nstring_values\n under these specified field keys are returned if any\nof the values matches the search keyword. Custom field values with\nparenthesis, brackets and special symbols won\nt be properly searchable,\nand those keyword queries need to be surrounded by quotes.\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n* \nname=duo\n\n    - Required during company update.\n\n\nThe resource name for a company. This is generated by the service when a\ncompany is created.\n\n\nThe format is \nprojects/{project_id}/companies/{company_id}\n, for example,\n\nprojects/api-test-project/companies/foo\n.\n* \nsize=et\n\n    - Optional.\n\n\nThe employer\ns company size.\n\n \nsuspended=true\n\n    - Output only. Indicates whether a company is flagged to be suspended from\npublic availability by the service when job content appears suspicious,\nabusive, or spammy.\n\n \nwebsite-uri=sanctus\n\n    - Optional.\n\n\nThe URI representing the company\ns primary web site or home page,\nfor example, \nhttps://www.google.com\n.\n\n\nThe maximum number of allowed characters is 255.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    update-mask=et\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional but strongly recommended for the best service\n    experience.\n\n\nIf update_mask is provided, only the specified fields in\ncompany are updated. Otherwise all the fields are updated.\n\n\nA field mask to specify the company fields to be updated. Only\ntop level fields of Company are supported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

For example, a structure like this:  UpdateCompanyRequest:\n  company:\n    career-site-uri: string\n    derived-info:\n      headquarters-location:\n        lat-lng:\n          latitude: number\n          longitude: number\n        location-type: string\n        postal-address:\n          address-lines: [string]\n          administrative-area: string\n          language-code: string\n          locality: string\n          organization: string\n          postal-code: string\n          recipients: [string]\n          region-code: string\n          revision: integer\n          sorting-code: string\n          sublocality: string\n        radius-in-miles: number\n    display-name: string\n    eeo-text: string\n    external-id: string\n    headquarters-address: string\n    hiring-agency: boolean\n    image-uri: string\n    keyword-searchable-job-custom-attributes: [string]\n    name: string\n    size: string\n    suspended: boolean\n    website-uri: string\n  update-mask: string  can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.    -r .company    career-site-uri=lorem    Optional.  The URI to employer s career site or careers page on the employer s web\nsite, for example,  https://careers.google.com .   derived-info.headquarters-location.lat-lng    latitude=0.795720263212 \n    - The latitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-90.0, +90.0].   longitude=0.313727897996 \n    - The longitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-180.0, +180.0].      ..    location-type=aliquyam   The type of a location, which corresponds to the address lines field of\n    PostalAddress. For example,  Downtown, Atlanta, GA, USA  has a type of\n    LocationType#NEIGHBORHOOD, and  Kansas City, KS, USA  has a type of\n    LocationType#LOCALITY.     postal-address    address-lines=sea    Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address.  Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may\nsometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. Austin, TX ), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of\naddress lines should be  envelope order  for the country/region of the\naddress. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is\nused to make it explicit (e.g.  ja  for large-to-small ordering and ja-Latn  or  en  for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of\nan address can be selected based on the language.  The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists\nof a region_code with all remaining information placed in the\naddress_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very\napproximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be\nmade about any of the address components until it was at least\npartially resolved.  Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and\nthen geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured\naddresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be\nlocalities or administrative areas).\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.   administrative-area=lorem \n    - Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal\naddresses of a country or region.\nFor example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture.\nSpecifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous\ncommunity (e.g.  Barcelona  and not  Catalonia ).\nMany countries don t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g.\nin Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.   language-code=eos \n    - Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if\nknown). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected\nto match one of the languages used in the address  country/region, or their\ntransliterated equivalents.\nThis can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical\nto the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or\nother non-formatting related operations.  If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a\npossibly incorrect default).  Examples:  zh-Hant ,  ja ,  ja-Latn ,  en .   locality=erat \n    - Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address.\nExamples: US city, IT comune, UK post town.\nIn regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit\ninto this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines.   organization=sadipscing \n    - Optional. The name of the organization at the address.   postal-code=dolor \n    - Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require\npostal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger\nadditional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip\nvalidation in the U.S.A.).   recipients=eirmod \n    - Optional. The recipient at the address.\nThis field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information.\nFor example, it might contain  care of  information.\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.   region-code=elitr \n    - Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This\nis never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is\ncorrect. See http://cldr.unicode.org/ and\nhttp://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html\nfor details. Example:  CH  for Switzerland.   revision=4 \n    - The schema revision of the  PostalAddress . This must be set to 0, which is\nthe latest revision.  All new revisions  must  be backward compatible with old revisions.   sorting-code=no \n    - Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used\nin most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like CEDEX , optionally followed by a number (e.g.  CEDEX 7 ), or just a number\nalone, representing the  sector code  (Jamaica),  delivery area indicator \n(Malawi) or  post office indicator  (e.g. C\u00f4te d Ivoire).   sublocality=labore \n    - Optional. Sublocality of the address.\nFor example, this can be neighborhoods, boroughs, districts.      ..    radius-in-miles=0.61974554549   Radius in meters of the job location. This value is derived from the\n    location bounding box in which a circle with the specified radius\n    centered from LatLng coves the area associated with the job location.\n    For example, currently,  Mountain View, CA, USA  has a radius of\n    6.17 miles.     ...    display-name=dolore    Required.  The display name of the company, for example,  Google, LLC .\n*  eeo-text=invidunt \n    - Optional.  Equal Employment Opportunity legal disclaimer text to be\nassociated with all jobs, and typically to be displayed in all\nroles.  The maximum number of allowed characters is 500.\n*  external-id=aliquyam \n    - Required.  Client side company identifier, used to uniquely identify the\ncompany.  The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.\n*  headquarters-address=accusam \n    - Optional.  The street address of the company s main headquarters, which may be\ndifferent from the job location. The service attempts\nto geolocate the provided address, and populates a more specific\nlocation wherever possible in DerivedInfo.headquarters_location.\n*  hiring-agency=false \n    - Optional.  Set to true if it is the hiring agency that post jobs for other\nemployers.  Defaults to false if not provided.\n*  image-uri=sea \n    - Optional.  A URI that hosts the employer s company logo.\n*  keyword-searchable-job-custom-attributes=et \n    - Optional.  A list of keys of filterable Job.custom_attributes, whose\ncorresponding  string_values  are used in keyword search. Jobs with string_values  under these specified field keys are returned if any\nof the values matches the search keyword. Custom field values with\nparenthesis, brackets and special symbols won t be properly searchable,\nand those keyword queries need to be surrounded by quotes.\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n*  name=duo \n    - Required during company update.  The resource name for a company. This is generated by the service when a\ncompany is created.  The format is  projects/{project_id}/companies/{company_id} , for example, projects/api-test-project/companies/foo .\n*  size=et \n    - Optional.  The employer s company size.   suspended=true \n    - Output only. Indicates whether a company is flagged to be suspended from\npublic availability by the service when job content appears suspicious,\nabusive, or spammy.   website-uri=sanctus \n    - Optional.  The URI representing the company s primary web site or home page,\nfor example,  https://www.google.com .  The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.      ..    update-mask=et    Optional but strongly recommended for the best service\n    experience.  If update_mask is provided, only the specified fields in\ncompany are updated. Otherwise all the fields are updated.  A field mask to specify the company fields to be updated. Only\ntop level fields of Company are supported.",

The resource name for the job. This is generated by the service when a\njob is created.  The format is  projects/{project_id}/jobs/{job_id} ,\nfor example,  projects/api-test-project/jobs/1234 .  Use of this field in job queries and API calls is preferred over the use of\nrequisition_id since this value is unique.   posting-create-time=clita \n    - Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was created.   posting-expire-time=consetetur \n    - Optional but strongly recommended for the best service\nexperience.  The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the\njob is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The\nexpired job can t be deleted or listed by the DeleteJob and\nListJobs APIs, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or\nupdated with the UpdateJob API. An expired job can be updated and\nopened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired\njob fails if there is another existing open job with same company_name,\nlanguage_code and requisition_id.  The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the\noverall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs\ncount over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are\ncleaned first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned\nout.  Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided.  Timestamp before the instant request is made is considered valid, the job\nwill be treated as expired immediately.  If this value is not provided at the time of job creation or is invalid,\nthe job posting expires after 30 days from the job s creation time. For\nexample, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an\nunspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC.  If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks\nset by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include\nexpiry_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is\nupdated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job s last\nupdate time. Otherwise the expiration date isn t updated.\n*  posting-publish-time=takimata \n    - Optional.  The timestamp this job posting was most recently published. The default\nvalue is the time the request arrives at the server. Invalid timestamps are\nignored.\n*  posting-region=nonumy \n    - Optional.  The job PostingRegion (for example, state, country) throughout which\nthe job is available. If this field is set, a\nLocationFilter in a search query within the job region\nfinds this job posting if an exact location match is not specified.\nIf this field is set to PostingRegion.NATION_WIDE or\n[PostingRegion.ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA], setting job addresses\nto the same location level as this field is strongly recommended.   posting-update-time=kasd \n    - Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was last updated.   processing-options    disable-street-address-resolution=true \n    - Optional.  If set to  true , the service does not attempt to resolve a\nmore precise address for the job.\n*  html-sanitization=takimata \n    - Optional.  Option for job HTML content sanitization.

A description of the qualifications required to perform the\njob. The use of this field is recommended\nas an alternative to using the more general description field.  This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts\nbold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags.  The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000.\n*  requisition-id=invidunt \n    - Required.  The requisition ID, also referred to as the posting ID, assigned by the\nclient to identify a job. This field is intended to be used by clients\nfor client identification and tracking of postings.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks\nset by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include\nexpiry_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is\nupdated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job s last\nupdate time. Otherwise the expiration date isn t updated.\n*  posting-publish-time=ut \n    - Optional.  The timestamp this job posting was most recently published. The default\nvalue is the time the request arrives at the server. Invalid timestamps are\nignored.\n*  posting-region=dolores \n    - Optional.

For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level.

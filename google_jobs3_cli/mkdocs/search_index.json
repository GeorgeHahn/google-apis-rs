Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/jobs3-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/jobs3-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \njobs\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \njobs3 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

Separate fields are\nprovided on the job object for responsibilities,\nqualifications, and other job characteristics. Use of\nthese separate job fields is recommended.  This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts\nbold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags.  The maximum number of allowed characters is 100,000.\n*  employment-types=et \n    - Optional.  The employment type(s) of a job, for example,\nfull time or\npart time.\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n*  incentives=clita \n    - Optional.  A description of bonus, commission, and other compensation\nincentives associated with the job not including salary or pay.  The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000.\n*  job-benefits=consetetur \n    - Optional.  The benefits included with the job.\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n*  job-end-time=takimata \n    - Optional.  The end timestamp of the job. Typically this field is used for contracting\nengagements. Invalid timestamps are ignored.\n*  job-level=nonumy \n    - Optional.  The experience level associated with the job, such as  Entry Level .\n*  job-start-time=kasd \n    - Optional.  The start timestamp of the job in UTC time zone. Typically this field\nis used for contracting engagements. Invalid timestamps are ignored.\n*  language-code=sanctus \n    - Optional.  The language of the posting. This field is distinct from\nany requirements for fluency that are associated with the job.  Language codes must be in BCP-47 format, such as  en-US  or  sr-Latn .\nFor more information, see Tags for Identifying Languages {:\nclass= external  target= _blank  }.  If this field is unspecified and Job.description is present, detected\nlanguage code based on Job.description is assigned, otherwise\ndefaults to  en_US .\n*  name=takimata \n    - Required during job update.  The resource name for the job. This is generated by the service when a\njob is created.  The format is  projects/{project_id}/jobs/{job_id} ,\nfor example,  projects/api-test-project/jobs/1234 .  Use of this field in job queries and API calls is preferred over the use of\nrequisition_id since this value is unique.\n*  posting-create-time=at \n    - Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was created.\n*  posting-expire-time=labore \n    - Optional but strongly recommended for the best service\nexperience.  The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the\njob is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The\nexpired job can t be deleted or listed by the DeleteJob and\nListJobs APIs, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or\nupdated with the UpdateJob API. An expired job can be updated and\nopened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired\njob fails if there is another existing open job with same company_name,\nlanguage_code and requisition_id.  The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the\noverall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs\ncount over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are\ncleaned first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned\nout.  Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided.  Timestamp before the instant request is made is considered valid, the job\nwill be treated as expired immediately.  If this value is not provided at the time of job creation or is invalid,\nthe job posting expires after 30 days from the job s creation time. For\nexample, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an\nunspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC.  If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks\nset by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include\nexpiry_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is\nupdated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job s last\nupdate time. Otherwise the expiration date isn t updated.\n*  posting-publish-time=invidunt \n    - Optional.  The timestamp this job posting was most recently published. The default\nvalue is the time the request arrives at the server. Invalid timestamps are\nignored.\n*  posting-region=ea \n    - Optional.  The job PostingRegion (for example, state, country) throughout which\nthe job is available. If this field is set, a\nLocationFilter in a search query within the job region\nfinds this job posting if an exact location match isn t specified.\nIf this field is set to PostingRegion.NATION or\nPostingRegion.ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA, setting job Job.addresses\nto the same location level as this field is strongly recommended.\n*  posting-update-time=sadipscing \n    - Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was last updated.\n*  processing-options    disable-street-address-resolution=false \n    - Optional.  If set to  true , the service does not attempt to resolve a\nmore precise address for the job.\n*  html-sanitization=dolore \n    - Optional.  Option for job HTML content sanitization. Applied fields are:   description  applicationInfo.instruction  incentives  qualifications  responsibilities   HTML tags in these fields may be stripped if sanitiazation is not\ndisabled.  Defaults to HtmlSanitization.SIMPLE_FORMATTING_ONLY.      ..    promotion-value=60    Optional.  A promotion value of the job, as determined by the client.\nThe value determines the sort order of the jobs returned when searching for\njobs using the featured jobs search call, with higher promotional values\nbeing returned first and ties being resolved by relevance sort. Only the\njobs with a promotionValue  0 are returned in a FEATURED_JOB_SEARCH.  Default value is 0, and negative values are treated as 0.\n*  qualifications=sed \n    - Optional.  A description of the qualifications required to perform the\njob. The use of this field is recommended\nas an alternative to using the more general description field.  This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts\nbold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags.  The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000.\n*  requisition-id=aliquyam \n    - Required.  The requisition ID, also referred to as the posting ID, assigned by the\nclient to identify a job. This field is intended to be used by clients\nfor client identification and tracking of postings.

If the field masks include\nexpiry_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is\nupdated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job\ns last\nupdate time. Otherwise the expiration date isn\nt updated.\n* \nposting-publish-time=ea\n\n    - Optional.\n\n\nThe timestamp this job posting was most recently published.

Otherwise all the fields are updated.\n\n\nA field mask to restrict the fields that are updated. Only\ntop level fields of Job are supported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly.

An expired job can be updated and\nopened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired\njob fails if there is another existing open job with same company_name,\nlanguage_code and requisition_id.  The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the\noverall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs\ncount over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are\ncleaned first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned\nout.  Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided.

If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks\nset by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include\nexpiry_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is\nupdated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job s last\nupdate time. Otherwise the expiration date isn t updated.\n*  posting-publish-time=ea \n    - Optional.  The timestamp this job posting was most recently published. The default\nvalue is the time the request arrives at the server. Invalid timestamps are\nignored.\n*  posting-region=ea \n    - Optional.  The job PostingRegion (for example, state, country) throughout which\nthe job is available. If this field is set, a\nLocationFilter in a search query within the job region\nfinds this job posting if an exact location match isn t specified.\nIf this field is set to PostingRegion.NATION or\nPostingRegion.ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA, setting job Job.addresses\nto the same location level as this field is strongly recommended.\n*  posting-update-time=et \n    - Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was last updated.\n*  processing-options    disable-street-address-resolution=true \n    - Optional.  If set to  true , the service does not attempt to resolve a\nmore precise address for the job.\n*  html-sanitization=diam \n    - Optional.  Option for job HTML content sanitization.

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level.

The client-defined scope or source of the service call, which typically\nis the domain on\nwhich the service has been implemented and is currently being run.  For example, if the service is being run by client  em Foo, Inc. /em , on\njob board www.foo.com and career site www.bar.com, then this field is\nset to  foo.com  for use on the job board, and  bar.com  for use on the\ncareer site.  If this field isn t available for some reason, send  UNKNOWN .\nAny improvements to the model for a particular tenant site rely on this\nfield being set correctly to a domain.

A session is defined as the\nduration of an end user s interaction with the service over a certain\nperiod.\nObfuscate this field for privacy concerns before\nproviding it to the service.  If this field is not available for some reason, send  UNKNOWN . Note\nthat any improvements to the model for a particular tenant\nsite, rely on this field being set correctly to some unique session_id.  The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.\n*  user-id=justo \n    - Required.  A unique user identification string, as determined by the client.\nTo have the strongest positive impact on search quality\nmake sure the client-level is unique.\nObfuscate this field for privacy concerns before\nproviding it to the service.  If this field is not available for some reason, send  UNKNOWN . Note\nthat any improvements to the model for a particular tenant\nsite, rely on this field being set correctly to a unique user_id.  The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.      ..    require-precise-result-size=true    Optional.  Controls if the search job request requires the return of a precise\ncount of the first 300 results. Setting this to  true  ensures\nconsistency in the number of results per page. Best practice is to set this\nvalue to true if a client allows users to jump directly to a\nnon-sequential search results page.  Enabling this flag may adversely impact performance.  Defaults to false.\n*  search-mode=gubergren \n    - Optional.  Mode of a search.  Defaults to SearchMode.JOB_SEARCH.",

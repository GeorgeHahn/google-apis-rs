You can change the directory used to store configuration with the \n--config-dir\n flag on a per-invocation basis.\n\n\nMore information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMost APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the \nscope\n determines the \nset of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/dataproc1-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/dataproc1-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \ndataproc\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \ndataproc1 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

Custom service accounts need permissions equivalent to the folloing IAM roles:\n    roles/logging.logWriter\n    roles/storage.objectAdmin(see https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts#custom_service_accounts for more information). Example: [account_id]@[project_id].iam.gserviceaccount.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\nservice-account-scopes=accusam\n\n\nOptional. The URIs of service account scopes to be included in Google Compute Engine instances. The following base set of scopes is always included:\n    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud.useraccounts.readonly\n    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_write\n    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/logging.writeIf no scopes are specified, the following defaults are also provided:\n    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/bigquery\n    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/bigtable.admin.table\n    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/bigtable.data\n    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.full_control\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsubnetwork-uri=takimata\n\n\nOptional. The Google Compute Engine subnetwork to be used for machine communications. Cannot be specified with network_uri.A full URL, partial URI, or short name are valid.

The zone where the Google Compute Engine cluster will be located. On a create request, it is required in the \nglobal\n region. If omitted in a non-global Cloud Dataproc region, the service will pick a zone in the corresponding Compute Engine region. On a get request, zone will always be present.A full URL, partial URI, or short name are valid. Examples:\n    https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/[project_id]/zones/[zone]\n    projects/[project_id]/zones/[zone]\n    us-central1-f\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..master-config.disk-config    boot-disk-size-gb=20\n\n\n\n\nOptional. Size in GB of the boot disk (default is 500GB).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnum-local-ssds=66\n\n\n\n\nOptional. Number of attached SSDs, from 0 to 4 (default is 0). If SSDs are not attached, the boot disk is used to store runtime logs and HDFS (https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/hdfs_user_guide.html) data. If one or more SSDs are attached, this runtime bulk data is spread across them, and the boot disk contains only basic config and installed binaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    image-uri=sea\n\n\n\n\nOutput-only. The Google Compute Engine image resource used for cluster instances. Inferred from SoftwareConfig.image_version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninstance-names=nonumy\n\n\nOptional. The list of instance names. Cloud Dataproc derives the names from cluster_name, num_instances, and the instance group if not set by user (recommended practice is to let Cloud Dataproc derive the name).\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nis-preemptible=true\n\n\nOptional. Specifies that this instance group contains preemptible instances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmachine-type-uri=gubergren\n\n\nOptional. The Google Compute Engine machine type used for cluster instances.A full URL, partial URI, or short name are valid.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level.

Additional state information, which includes status reported by the agent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that \n-p\n is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this \n-p k1=v1 k2=v2\n even though the listing below repeats the\n\n-p\n for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n-p update-mask=string\n\n\nRequired. Specifies the path, relative to \ncode\nJob\n/code\n, of the field to update. For example, to update the labels of a Job the \ncode\nupdate_mask\n/code\n parameter would be specified as \ncode\nlabels\n/code\n, and the PATCH request body would specify the new value. \nstrong\nNote:\n/strong\n Currently, \ncode\nlabels\n/code\n is the only field that can be updated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p bearer-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth bearer token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p oauth-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth 2.0 token for the current user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p pp=boolean\n\n\n\n\nPretty-print response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p pretty-print=boolean\n\n\n\n\nReturns response with indentations and line breaks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p quota-user=string\n\n\n\n\nAvailable to use for quota purposes for server-side applications.

For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p bearer-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth bearer token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

You can change the directory used to store configuration with the \n--config-dir\n flag on a per-invocation basis.\n\n\nMore information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMost APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the \nscope\n determines the \nset of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/dataproc1-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/dataproc1-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \ndataproc\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \ndataproc1 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

The name of the Instance Group Manager for this group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninstance-template-name=consetetur\n\n\n\n\nOutput only. The name of the Instance Template used for the Managed Instance Group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    num-instances=49\n\n\n\n\nOptional. The number of VM instances in the instance group.

It is required for an UpdateWorkflowTemplate request, and must match the current server version. A typical update template flow would fetch the current template with a GetWorkflowTemplate request, which will return the current template with the version field filled in with the current server version. The user updates other fields in the template, then returns it as part of the UpdateWorkflowTemplate request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

The user updates other fields in the template, then returns it as part of the UpdateWorkflowTemplate request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that \n-p\n is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this \n-p k1=v1 k2=v2\n even though the listing below repeats the\n\n-p\n for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n-p request-id=string\n\n\nOptional. A tag that prevents multiple concurrent workflow instances with the same tag from running. This mitigates risk of concurrent instances started due to retries.It is recommended to always set this value to a UUID (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier).The tag must contain only letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), underscores (_), and hyphens (-). The maximum length is 40 characters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p oauth-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth 2.0 token for the current user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p pretty-print=boolean\n\n\n\n\nReturns response with indentations and line breaks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p quota-user=string\n\n\n\n\nAvailable to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p upload-type=string\n\n\n\n\nLegacy upload protocol for media (e.g. \nmedia\n, \nmultipart\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p upload-protocol=string\n\n\n\n\nUpload protocol for media (e.g. \nraw\n, \nmultipart\n).",

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nSetIamPolicyRequest:\n  policy:\n    etag: string\n    version: integer\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .policy    etag=et\n\n\netag is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An etag is returned in the response to getIamPolicy, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to setIamPolicy to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.If no etag is provided in the call to setIamPolicy, then the existing policy is overwritten blindly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nversion=53\n\n\nDeprecated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level.

A unique id used to identify the request. If the server receives two CreateClusterRequest requests with the same id, then the second request will be ignored and the first google.longrunning.Operation created and stored in the backend is returned.It is recommended to always set this value to a UUID (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier).The id must contain only letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), underscores (_), and hyphens (-).

For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n.

Additional state information that includes status reported by the agent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that \n-p\n is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this \n-p k1=v1 k2=v2\n even though the listing below repeats the\n\n-p\n for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p update-mask=string\n\n\n\n\nRequired. Specifies the path, relative to Cluster, of the field to update. For example, to change the number of workers in a cluster to 5, the update_mask parameter would be specified as config.worker_config.num_instances, and the PATCH request body would specify the new value, as follows:\n    {\n      \nconfig\n:{\n        \nworkerConfig\n:{\n          \nnumInstances\n:\n5\n\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    Similarly, to change the number of preemptible workers in a cluster to 5, the update_mask parameter would be config.secondary_worker_config.num_instances, and the PATCH request body would be set as follows:\n    {\n      \nconfig\n:{\n        \nsecondaryWorkerConfig\n:{\n          \nnumInstances\n:\n5\n\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    \nstrong\nNote:\n/strong\n Currently, only the following fields can be updated:\ntable\n  \ntbody\n  \ntr\n  \ntd\nstrong\nMask\n/strong\n/td\n  \ntd\nstrong\nPurpose\n/strong\n/td\n  \n/tr\n  \ntr\n  \ntd\nstrong\nem\nlabels\n/em\n/strong\n/td\n  \ntd\nUpdate labels\n/td\n  \n/tr\n  \ntr\n  \ntd\nstrong\nem\nconfig.worker_config.num_instances\n/em\n/strong\n/td\n  \ntd\nResize primary worker group\n/td\n  \n/tr\n  \ntr\n  \ntd\nstrong\nem\nconfig.secondary_worker_config.num_instances\n/em\n/strong\n/td\n  \ntd\nResize secondary worker group\n/td\n  \n/tr\n  \n/tbody\n  \n/table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p request-id=string\n\n\n\n\nOptional. A unique id used to identify the request. If the server receives two UpdateClusterRequest requests with the same id, then the second request will be ignored and the first google.longrunning.Operation created and stored in the backend is returned.It is recommended to always set this value to a UUID (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier).The id must contain only letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), underscores (_), and hyphens (-). The maximum length is 40 characters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p graceful-decommission-timeout=string\n\n\n\n\nOptional. Timeout for graceful YARN decomissioning. Graceful decommissioning allows removing nodes from the cluster without interrupting jobs in progress. Timeout specifies how long to wait for jobs in progress to finish before forcefully removing nodes (and potentially interrupting jobs). Default timeout is 0 (for forceful decommission), and the maximum allowed timeout is 1 day.Only supported on Dataproc image versions 1.2 and higher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level.

Please note that \n-p\n is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this \n-p k1=v1 k2=v2\n even though the listing below repeats the\n\n-p\n for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n-p update-mask=string\n\n\nRequired. Specifies the path, relative to \ncode\nJob\n/code\n, of the field to update. For example, to update the labels of a Job the \ncode\nupdate_mask\n/code\n parameter would be specified as \ncode\nlabels\n/code\n, and the PATCH request body would specify the new value. \nstrong\nNote:\n/strong\n Currently, \ncode\nlabels\n/code\n is the only field that can be updated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p oauth-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth 2.0 token for the current user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p pretty-print=boolean\n\n\n\n\nReturns response with indentations and line breaks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p quota-user=string\n\n\n\n\nAvailable to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p upload-type=string\n\n\n\n\nLegacy upload protocol for media (e.g. \nmedia\n, \nmultipart\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p upload-protocol=string\n\n\n\n\nUpload protocol for media (e.g. \nraw\n, \nmultipart\n).",

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

The user updates other fields in the template, then returns it as part of the UpdateWorkflowTemplate request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly.

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

The user updates other fields in the template, then returns it as part of the UpdateWorkflowTemplate request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that \n-p\n is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this \n-p k1=v1 k2=v2\n even though the listing below repeats the\n\n-p\n for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n-p request-id=string\n\n\nOptional. A tag that prevents multiple concurrent workflow instances with the same tag from running. This mitigates risk of concurrent instances started due to retries.It is recommended to always set this value to a UUID (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier).The tag must contain only letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), underscores (_), and hyphens (-). The maximum length is 40 characters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

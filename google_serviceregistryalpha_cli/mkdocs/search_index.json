Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero.\n\n\nIf data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools.\n\n\nEverything else about the \nService Registry\n API can be found at the\n\nofficial documentation site\n.\n\n\nInstallation and Source Code\n\n\nInstall the command-line interface with cargo using:\n\n\ncargo install google-serviceregistryalpha-cli\n\n\n\n\nFind the source code \non github\n.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nThis documentation was generated from the \nService Registry\n API at revision \n20160401\n.

The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/serviceregistryalpha-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nEndpoint:\n  address: string\n  creation-timestamp: string\n  description: string\n  fingerprint: string\n  id: string\n  name: string\n  port: integer\n  self-link: string\n  state: string\n  visibility:\n    networks: [string]\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .    address=eirmod\n\n\nA user-provided address of the service represented by this endpoint. This can be an IPv4 or IPv6 address, or a hostname.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncreation-timestamp=sit\n\n\n[Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndescription=stet\n\n\nAn optional user-provided description of the endpoint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfingerprint=sed\n\n\nSupply the fingerprint value for update requests. The fingerprint value is generated by the server and ensures optimistic concurrency (so that only one update can be performed at a time). The fingerprint changes after each update.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid=et\n\n\n[Output Only] Unique identifier for the resource; defined by the server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname=dolores\n\n\nA user-provided name of the endpoint, which must be unique within the project. The name must comply with RFC1035.

By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.\n\n\nYou can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy=\ncreationTimestamp desc\n. This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.\n\n\nCurrently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p page-token=string\n\n\n\n\nSpecifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p max-results=integer\n\n\n\n\nThe maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p filter=string\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.\n\n\nThe field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.\n\n\nFor example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.\n\n\nCompute Engine Beta API Only: When filtering in the Beta API, you can also filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.\n\n\nThe Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

Please note that  -p  is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this  -p k1=v1 k2=v2  even though the listing below repeats the -p  for completeness.    -p order-by=string    Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy= creationTimestamp desc . This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.      -p page-token=string   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.     -p max-results=integer   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.     -p filter=string    Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.  The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.  For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.  Compute Engine Beta API Only: When filtering in the Beta API, you can also filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.  The Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.",

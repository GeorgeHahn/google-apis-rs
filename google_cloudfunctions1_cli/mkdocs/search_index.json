You can change the directory used to store configuration with the \n--config-dir\n flag on a per-invocation basis.\n\n\nMore information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMost APIs require a user to authenticate any request.

The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/cloudfunctions1-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/cloudfunctions1-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \ncloudfunctions\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \ncloudfunctions1 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

For\n    example, the Google Cloud Storage API includes the type \nobject\n.\n 3. action: The action that generates the event.

For example, an \nEventTrigger\n that has an\n   \nevent_type\n of \ngoogle.pubsub.topic.publish\n should have a resource\n   that matches Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, some services may support short names when creating an\n\nEventTrigger\n.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.  For example, a structure like this:  CloudFunction:\n  available-memory-mb: integer\n  description: string\n  entry-point: string\n  event-trigger:\n    event-type: string\n    resource: string\n    service: string\n  https-trigger:\n    url: string\n  labels: { string: string }\n  name: string\n  service-account-email: string\n  source-archive-url: string\n  source-repository:\n    deployed-url: string\n    url: string\n  source-upload-url: string\n  status: string\n  timeout: string\n  update-time: string\n  version-id: string  can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.   -r .    available-memory-mb=40  The amount of memory in MB available for a function.\n    Defaults to 256MB.    description=justo  User-provided description of a function.    entry-point=justo  The name of the function (as defined in source code) that will be\n    executed. Defaults to the resource name suffix, if not specified. For\n    backward compatibility, if function with given name is not found, then the\n    system will try to use function named  function .\n    For Node.js this is name of a function exported by the module specified\n    in  source_location .     event-trigger    event-type=et    Required. The type of event to observe. For example:\n     providers/cloud.storage/eventTypes/object.change  and\n     providers/cloud.pubsub/eventTypes/topic.publish .  Event types match pattern  providers/*/eventTypes/*.* .\nThe pattern contains:\n 1. namespace: For example,  cloud.storage  and\n     google.firebase.analytics .\n 2. resource type: The type of resource on which event occurs. For\n    example, the Google Cloud Storage API includes the type  object .\n 3. action: The action that generates the event. For example, action for\n    a Google Cloud Storage Object is  change .\nThese parts are lower case.\n*  resource=et \n    - Required. The resource(s) from which to observe events, for example, projects/_/buckets/myBucket .  Not all syntactically correct values are accepted by all services. For\nexample:   The authorization model must support it. Google Cloud Functions\n   only allows EventTriggers to be deployed that observe resources in the\n   same project as the  CloudFunction .  The resource type must match the pattern expected for an\n    event_type . For example, an  EventTrigger  that has an\n    event_type  of  google.pubsub.topic.publish  should have a resource\n   that matches Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics.   Additionally, some services may support short names when creating an EventTrigger . These will always be returned in the normalized  long \nformat.  See each  service s  documentation for supported formats.\n*  service=diam \n    - The hostname of the service that should be observed.  If no string is provided, the default service implementing the API will\nbe used. For example,  storage.googleapis.com  is the default for all\nevent types in the  google.storage  namespace.      ..https-trigger    url=ipsum   Output only. The deployed url for the function.     ..    labels=key=lorem   Labels associated with this Cloud Function.  the value will be associated with the given  key    name=et  A user-defined name of the function. Function names must be unique\n    globally and match pattern  projects/*/locations/*/functions/*    service-account-email=duo  Output only. The email of the function s service account.    source-archive-url=aliquyam  The Google Cloud Storage URL, starting with gs://, pointing to the zip\n    archive which contains the function.    source-repository    deployed-url=sea  Output only. The URL pointing to the hosted repository where the function\n    were defined at the time of deployment. It always points to a specific\n    commit in the format described above.     url=lorem    The URL pointing to the hosted repository where the function is defined.\n    There are supported Cloud Source Repository URLs in the following\n    formats:  To refer to a specific commit: https://source.developers.google.com/projects/*/repos/*/revisions/*/paths/* \nTo refer to a moveable alias (branch): https://source.developers.google.com/projects/*/repos/*/moveable-aliases/*/paths/* \nIn particular, to refer to HEAD use  master  moveable alias.\nTo refer to a specific fixed alias (tag): https://source.developers.google.com/projects/*/repos/*/fixed-aliases/*/paths/*  You may omit  paths/*  if you want to use the main directory.      ..    source-upload-url=eos   The Google Cloud Storage signed URL used for source uploading, generated\n    by google.cloud.functions.v1.GenerateUploadUrl    status=erat  Output only. Status of the function deployment.    timeout=sadipscing  The function execution timeout. Execution is considered failed and\n    can be terminated if the function is not completed at the end of the\n    timeout period. Defaults to 60 seconds.    update-time=dolor  Output only. The last update timestamp of a Cloud Function.    version-id=eirmod  Output only.\n    The version identifier of the Cloud Function.

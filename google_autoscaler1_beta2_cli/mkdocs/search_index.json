No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/autoscaler1-beta2-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \nautoscaler\n API \nwas enabled for it.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nAutoscaler:\n  autoscaling-policy:\n    cool-down-period-sec: integer\n    cpu-utilization:\n      utilization-target: number\n    load-balancing-utilization:\n      utilization-target: number\n    max-num-replicas: integer\n    min-num-replicas: integer\n  creation-timestamp: string\n  description: string\n  id: string\n  kind: string\n  name: string\n  self-link: string\n  target: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .autoscaling-policy    cool-down-period-sec=62\n\n\nThe number of seconds that the Autoscaler should wait between two succeeding changes to the number of virtual machines. You should define an interval that is at least as long as the initialization time of a virtual machine and the time it may take for replica pool to create the virtual machine. The default is 60 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncpu-utilization    utilization-target=0.533265573605\n\n\n\n\nThe target utilization that the Autoscaler should maintain.

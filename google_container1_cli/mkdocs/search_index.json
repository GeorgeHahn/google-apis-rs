No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/container1-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \ncontainer\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \ncontainer1 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

The version can be upgraded over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninitial-node-count=100\n\n\nThe number of nodes to create in this cluster. You must ensure that your Compute Engine resource quota is sufficient for this number of instances. You must also have available firewall and routes quota. For requests, this field should only be used in lieu of a \nnode_pool\n object, since this configuration (along with the \nnode_config\n) will be used to create a \nNodePool\n object with an auto-generated name.

If left unspecified, the \ndefault\n network will be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnode-config    disk-size-gb=80\n\n\nSize of the disk attached to each node, specified in GB. The smallest allowed disk size is 10GB. If unspecified, the default disk size is 100GB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmachine-type=et\n\n\nThe name of a Google Compute Engine \nmachine type\n (e.g. \nn1-standard-1\n). If unspecified, the default machine type is \nn1-standard-1\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmetadata=key=et\n\n\nThe metadata key/value pairs assigned to instances in the cluster. Keys must conform to the regexp [a-zA-Z0-9-_]+ and be less than 128 bytes in length. These are reflected as part of a URL in the metadata server. Additionally, to avoid ambiguity, keys must not conflict with any other metadata keys for the project or be one of the four reserved keys: \ninstance-template\n, \nkube-env\n, \nstartup-script\n, and \nuser-data\n Values are free-form strings, and only have meaning as interpreted by the image running in the instance. The only restriction placed on them is that each value\ns size must be less than or equal to 32 KB. The total size of all keys and values must be less than 512 KB.\n\n\nthe value will be associated with the given \nkey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noauth-scopes=diam\n\n\n\n\nThe set of Google API scopes to be made available on all of the node VMs under the \ndefault\n service account.

If unspecified, no scopes are added, unless Cloud Logging or Cloud Monitoring are enabled, in which case their required scopes will be added.\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    node-ipv4-cidr-size=46\n\n\n\n\n[Output only] The size of the address space on each node for hosting containers. This is provisioned from within the \ncontainer_ipv4_cidr\n range.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nself-link=lorem\n\n\n[Output only] Server-defined URL for the resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nservices-ipv4-cidr=et\n\n\n[Output only] The IP address range of the Kubernetes services in this cluster, in \nCIDR\n notation (e.g. \n1.2.3.4/29\n).

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nUpdateClusterRequest:\n  update:\n    desired-addons-config:\n      horizontal-pod-autoscaling:\n        disabled: boolean\n      http-load-balancing:\n        disabled: boolean\n    desired-master-version: string\n    desired-monitoring-service: string\n    desired-node-pool-id: string\n    desired-node-version: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-r .update.desired-addons-config.horizontal-pod-autoscaling    disabled=true\n\n\n\n\nWhether the Horizontal Pod Autoscaling feature is enabled in the cluster. When enabled, it ensures that a Heapster pod is running in the cluster, which is also used by the Cloud Monitoring service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..http-load-balancing    disabled=false\n\n\n\n\nWhether the HTTP Load Balancing controller is enabled in the cluster. When enabled, it runs a small pod in the cluster that manages the load balancers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...    desired-master-version=accusam\n\n\n\n\nThe Kubernetes version to change the master to. The only valid value is the latest supported version. Use \n-\n to have the server automatically select the latest version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndesired-monitoring-service=lorem\n\n\nThe monitoring service the cluster should use to write metrics. Currently available options: * \nmonitoring.googleapis.com\n - the Google Cloud Monitoring service * \nnone\n - no metrics will be exported from the cluster\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndesired-node-pool-id=sea\n\n\nThe node pool to be upgraded. This field is mandatory if the \ndesired_node_version\n or \ndesired_image_family\n is specified and there is more than one node pool on the cluster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndesired-node-version=et\n\n\nThe Kubernetes version to change the nodes to (typically an upgrade). Use \n-\n to upgrade to the latest version supported by the server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level.

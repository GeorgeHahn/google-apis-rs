Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/container1-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/container1-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \ncontainer\n API \nwas enabled for it.

This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \ncontainer1 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

If left unspecified, the \ndefault\n network will be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnode-config    disk-size-gb=70\n\n\nSize of the disk attached to each node, specified in GB. The smallest allowed disk size is 10GB. If unspecified, the default disk size is 100GB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmachine-type=ea\n\n\nThe name of a Google Compute Engine \nmachine type\n (e.g. \nn1-standard-1\n).

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p bearer-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth bearer token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.   -r .cluster    cluster-ipv4-cidr=eirmod  The IP address range of the container pods in this cluster, in  CIDR  notation (e.g.  10.96.0.0/14 ). Leave blank to have one automatically chosen or specify a  /14  block in  10.0.0.0/8 .    create-time=sit  [Output only] The time the cluster was created, in  RFC3339  text format.    current-master-version=stet  [Output only] The current software version of the master endpoint.    current-node-version=sed  [Output only] The current version of the node software components. If they are currently at different versions because they re in the process of being upgraded, this reflects the minimum version of any of them.    description=et  An optional description of this cluster.    endpoint=dolores  [Output only] The IP address of this cluster s Kubernetes master endpoint. The endpoint can be accessed from the internet at  https://username:password@endpoint/ . See the  masterAuth  property of this resource for username and password information.    initial-cluster-version=kasd  [Output only] The software version of Kubernetes master and kubelets used in the cluster when it was first created. The version can be upgraded over time.    initial-node-count=79  The number of nodes to create in this cluster. You must ensure that your Compute Engine  resource quota  is sufficient for this number of instances. You must also have available firewall and routes quota.    instance-group-urls=takimata  [Output only] The resource URLs of  instance groups  associated with this cluster.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    logging-service=justo  The logging service that the cluster should write logs to. Currently available options: *  logging.googleapis.com  - the Google Cloud Logging service *  none  - no logs will be exported from the cluster *   - default value; the default is  logging.googleapis.com    master-auth    client-certificate=amet.  [Output only] Base64 encoded public certificate used by clients to authenticate to the cluster endpoint.    client-key=erat  [Output only] Base64 encoded private key used by clients to authenticate to the cluster endpoint.    cluster-ca-certificate=labore  [Output only] Base64 encoded public certificate that is the root of trust for the cluster.    password=sea  The password to use for HTTP basic authentication when accessing the Kubernetes master endpoint. Because the master endpoint is open to the internet, you should create a strong password.     username=nonumy   The username to use for HTTP basic authentication when accessing the Kubernetes master endpoint.     ..    monitoring-service=dolores   The monitoring service that the cluster should write metrics to. Currently available options: *  monitoring.googleapis.com  - the Google Cloud Monitoring service *  none  - no metrics will be exported from the cluster *   - default value; the default is  monitoring.googleapis.com    name=gubergren  The name of this cluster. The name must be unique within this project and zone, and can be up to 40 characters with the following restrictions: * Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only. * Must start with a letter. * Must end with a number or a letter.    network=sadipscing  The name of the Google Compute Engine  network  to which the cluster is connected. If left unspecified, the  default  network will be used.    node-config    disk-size-gb=70  Size of the disk attached to each node, specified in GB. The smallest allowed disk size is 10GB. If unspecified, the default disk size is 100GB.    machine-type=ea  The name of a Google Compute Engine  machine type  (e.g.  n1-standard-1 ). If unspecified, the default machine type is  n1-standard-1 .     oauth-scopes=no   The set of Google API scopes to be made available on all of the node VMs under the  default  service account. The following scopes are recommended, but not required, and by default are not included: *  https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute  is required for mounting persistent storage on your nodes. *  https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only  is required for communicating with  gcr.io . If unspecified, no scopes are added.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.     ..    node-ipv4-cidr-size=80   [Output only] The size of the address space on each node for hosting containers. This is provisioned from within the container_ipv4_cidr range.    self-link=justo  [Output only] Server-defined URL for the resource.    services-ipv4-cidr=et  [Output only] The IP address range of the Kubernetes services in this cluster, in  CIDR  notation (e.g.  1.2.3.4/29 ). Service addresses are typically put in the last /16 from the container CIDR.    status=et  [Output only] The current status of this cluster.    status-message=diam  [Output only] Additional information about the current status of this cluster, if available.    zone=ipsum  [Output only] The name of the Google Compute Engine  zone  in which the cluster resides.     About Cursors  The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:   The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the  .  character. Fields can be nested such as in  -r f.s.o  .  The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. . Each additional  .  moves it up one additional level. E.g.  ...  would go three levels up.",

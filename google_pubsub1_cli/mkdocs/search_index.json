The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/pubsub1-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/pubsub1-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \npubsub\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \npubsub1 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

That is, you can set the\nacknowledgment state of messages in an existing subscription to the state\ncaptured by a snapshot.\n\nbr\nbr\nIf the snapshot already exists, returns \nALREADY_EXISTS\n.\nIf the requested subscription doesn\nt exist, returns \nNOT_FOUND\n.\nIf the backlog in the subscription is too old -- and the resulting snapshot\nwould expire in less than 1 hour -- then \nFAILED_PRECONDITION\n is returned.\nSee also the \nSnapshot.expire_time\n field. If the name is not provided in\nthe request, the server will assign a random\nname for this snapshot on the same project as the subscription, conforming\nto the\n\nresource name\nformat\n. The\ngenerated name is populated in the returned Snapshot object. Note that for\nREST API requests, you must specify a name in the request.\n\n\nScopes\n\n\nYou will need authorization for at least one of the following scopes to make a valid call:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\n\n\nhttps://www.googleapis.com/auth/pubsub\n\n\n\n\nIf unset, the scope for this method defaults to \nhttps://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\n.\nYou can set the scope for this method like this: \npubsub1 --scope \nscope\n projects snapshots-create ...\n\n\nRequired Scalar Argument\n\n\n\n\nname\n \n(string)\n\n\nOptional user-provided name for this snapshot.\n    If the name is not provided in the request, the server will assign a random\n    name for this snapshot on the same project as the subscription.\n    Note that for REST API requests, you must specify a name.  See the\n    \na href=\nhttps://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/admin#resource_names\n\n    resource name rules\n/a\n.\n    Format is \nprojects/{project}/snapshots/{snap}\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired Request Value\n\n\nThe request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nCreateSnapshotRequest:\n  labels: { string: string }\n  subscription: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .    labels=key=eirmod\n\n\nSee \na href=\nhttps://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/labels\n Creating and\n    managing labels\n/a\n.\n\n\nthe value will be associated with the given \nkey\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsubscription=sit\n\n\nThe subscription whose backlog the snapshot retains.\n    Specifically, the created snapshot is guaranteed to retain:\n     (a) The existing backlog on the subscription. More precisely, this is\n         defined as the messages in the subscription\ns backlog that are\n         unacknowledged upon the successful completion of the\n         \nCreateSnapshot\n request; as well as:\n     (b) Any messages published to the subscription\ns topic following the\n         successful completion of the CreateSnapshot request.\n    Format is \nprojects/{project}/subscriptions/{sub}\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

In the\n    interval after the message is delivered and before it is acknowledged, it\n    is considered to be \ni\noutstanding\n/i\n. During that time period, the\n    message will not be redelivered (on a best-effort basis).\n\n\nFor pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial value for the ack\ndeadline. To override this value for a given message, call\n\nModifyAckDeadline\n with the corresponding \nack_id\n if using\nnon-streaming pull or send the \nack_id\n in a\n\nStreamingModifyAckDeadlineRequest\n if using streaming pull.\nThe minimum custom deadline you can specify is 10 seconds.\nThe maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes).\nIf this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used.\n\n\nFor push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout for\nthe call to the push endpoint.\n\n\nIf the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub\nsystem will eventually redeliver the message.\n* \nexpiration-policy    ttl=labore\n\n    - Specifies the \ntime-to-live\n duration for an associated resource. The\nresource expires if it is not active for a period of \nttl\n. The definition\nof \nactivity\n depends on the type of the associated resource. The minimum\nand maximum allowed values for \nttl\n depend on the type of the associated\nresource, as well. If \nttl\n is not set, the associated resource never\nexpires.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    labels=key=sea\n\n\n\n\nSee \na href=\nhttps://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/labels\n Creating and\n    managing labels\n/a\n.\n\n\nthe value will be associated with the given \nkey\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmessage-retention-duration=nonumy\n\n\nHow long to retain unacknowledged messages in the subscription\ns backlog,\n    from the moment a message is published.\n    If \nretain_acked_messages\n is true, then this also configures the retention\n    of acknowledged messages, and thus configures how far back in time a \nSeek\n\n    can be done.

It must have the format\n    \n#34;projects/{project}/subscriptions/{subscription}\n#34;\n. \n{subscription}\n must\n    start with a letter, and contain only letters (\n[A-Za-z]\n), numbers\n    (\n[0-9]\n), dashes (\n-\n), underscores (\n_\n), periods (\n.\n), tildes (\n~\n),\n    plus (\n+\n) or percent signs (\n%\n).

This attribute\nindicates the version of the data expected by the endpoint. This\ncontrols the shape of the pushed message (i.e., its fields and metadata).\nThe endpoint version is based on the version of the Pub/Sub API.\n\n\nIf not present during the \nCreateSubscription\n call, it will default to\nthe version of the API used to make such call. If not present during a\n\nModifyPushConfig\n call, its value will not be changed. \nGetSubscription\n\ncalls will always return a valid version, even if the subscription was\ncreated without this attribute.\n\n\nThe possible values for this attribute are:\n\n\n\n\nv1beta1\n: uses the push format defined in the v1beta1 Pub/Sub API.\n\n\nv1\n or \nv1beta2\n: uses the push format defined in the v1 Pub/Sub API.\n\n\nthe value will be associated with the given \nkey\n\n\n\n\n\n\noidc-token    audience=sadipscing\n\n\nAudience to be used when generating OIDC token.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nModifyAckDeadlineRequest:\n  ack-deadline-seconds: integer\n  ack-ids: [string]\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .    ack-deadline-seconds=80\n\n\nThe new ack deadline with respect to the time this request was sent to\n    the Pub/Sub system. For example, if the value is 10, the new\n    ack deadline will expire 10 seconds after the \nModifyAckDeadline\n call\n    was made. Specifying zero might immediately make the message available for\n    delivery to another subscriber client. This typically results in an\n    increase in the rate of message redeliveries (that is, duplicates).\n    The minimum deadline you can specify is 0 seconds.\n    The maximum deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nack-ids=et\n\n\nList of acknowledgment IDs.\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.    -r .subscription    ack-deadline-seconds=80    The approximate amount of time (on a best-effort basis) Pub/Sub waits for\n    the subscriber to acknowledge receipt before resending the message. In the\n    interval after the message is delivered and before it is acknowledged, it\n    is considered to be  i outstanding /i . During that time period, the\n    message will not be redelivered (on a best-effort basis).  For pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial value for the ack\ndeadline. To override this value for a given message, call ModifyAckDeadline  with the corresponding  ack_id  if using\nnon-streaming pull or send the  ack_id  in a StreamingModifyAckDeadlineRequest  if using streaming pull.\nThe minimum custom deadline you can specify is 10 seconds.\nThe maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes).\nIf this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used.  For push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout for\nthe call to the push endpoint.  If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub\nsystem will eventually redeliver the message.\n*  expiration-policy    ttl=duo \n    - Specifies the  time-to-live  duration for an associated resource. The\nresource expires if it is not active for a period of  ttl . The definition\nof  activity  depends on the type of the associated resource.

Every endpoint has a set of API supported attributes that can be used to\ncontrol different aspects of the message delivery.  The currently supported attribute is  x-goog-version , which you can\nuse to change the format of the pushed message. This attribute\nindicates the version of the data expected by the endpoint. This\ncontrols the shape of the pushed message (i.e., its fields and metadata).\nThe endpoint version is based on the version of the Pub/Sub API.  If not present during the  CreateSubscription  call, it will default to\nthe version of the API used to make such call. If not present during a ModifyPushConfig  call, its value will not be changed.  GetSubscription \ncalls will always return a valid version, even if the subscription was\ncreated without this attribute.  The possible values for this attribute are:   v1beta1 : uses the push format defined in the v1beta1 Pub/Sub API.  v1  or  v1beta2 : uses the push format defined in the v1 Pub/Sub API.  the value will be associated with the given  key    oidc-token    audience=erat  Audience to be used when generating OIDC token. The audience claim\nidentifies the recipients that the JWT is intended for. The audience\nvalue is a single case-sensitive string.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nUpdateTopicRequest:\n  topic:\n    kms-key-name: string\n    labels: { string: string }\n    message-storage-policy:\n      allowed-persistence-regions: [string]\n    name: string\n  update-mask: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

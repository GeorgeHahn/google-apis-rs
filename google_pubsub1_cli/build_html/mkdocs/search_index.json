You can change the directory used to store configuration with the \n--config-dir\n flag on a per-invocation basis.\n\n\nMore information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMost APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the \nscope\n determines the \nset of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/pubsub1-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/pubsub1-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \npubsub\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \npubsub1 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

It must have the format \n#34;projects/{project}/subscriptions/{subscription}\n#34;\n. \n{subscription}\n must start with a letter, and contain only letters (\n[A-Za-z]\n), numbers (\n[0-9]\n), dashes (\n-\n), underscores (\n_\n), periods (\n.\n), tildes (\n~\n), plus (\n+\n) or percent signs (\n%\n). It must be between 3 and 255 characters in length, and it must not start with \n#34;goog\n#34;\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired Request Value\n\n\nThe request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nSubscription:\n  ack-deadline-seconds: integer\n  name: string\n  push-config:\n    attributes: { string: string }\n    push-endpoint: string\n  topic: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .    ack-deadline-seconds=53\n\n\nThis value is the maximum time after a subscriber receives a message before the subscriber should acknowledge the message. After message delivery but before the ack deadline expires and before the message is acknowledged, it is an outstanding message and will not be delivered again during that time (on a best-effort basis). For pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial value for the ack deadline. To override this value for a given message, call \nModifyAckDeadline\n with the corresponding \nack_id\n if using pull. For push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout for the call to the push endpoint. If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub system will eventually redeliver the message. If this parameter is not set, the default value of 10 seconds is used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname=stet\n\n\nThe name of the subscription. It must have the format \n#34;projects/{project}/subscriptions/{subscription}\n#34;\n. \n{subscription}\n must start with a letter, and contain only letters (\n[A-Za-z]\n), numbers (\n[0-9]\n), dashes (\n-\n), underscores (\n_\n), periods (\n.\n), tildes (\n~\n), plus (\n+\n) or percent signs (\n%\n). It must be between 3 and 255 characters in length, and it must not start with \n#34;goog\n#34;\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npush-config    attributes=key=sed\n\n\nEndpoint configuration attributes. Every endpoint has a set of API supported attributes that can be used to control different aspects of the message delivery. The currently supported attribute is \nx-goog-version\n, which you can use to change the format of the push message. This attribute indicates the version of the data expected by the endpoint. This controls the shape of the envelope (i.e. its fields and metadata). The endpoint version is based on the version of the Pub/Sub API. If not present during the \nCreateSubscription\n call, it will default to the version of the API used to make such call. If not present during a \nModifyPushConfig\n call, its value will not be changed. \nGetSubscription\n calls will always return a valid version, even if the subscription was created without this attribute. The possible values for this attribute are: * \nv1beta1\n: uses the push format defined in the v1beta1 Pub/Sub API. * \nv1\n or \nv1beta2\n: uses the push format defined in the v1 Pub/Sub API.\n\n\nthe value will be associated with the given \nkey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npush-endpoint=et\n\n\n\n\nA URL locating the endpoint to which messages should be pushed. For example, a Webhook endpoint might use \nhttps://example.com/push\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    topic=dolores\n\n\n\n\nThe name of the topic from which this subscription is receiving messages. The value of this field will be \n_deleted-topic_\n if the topic has been deleted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p bearer-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth bearer token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

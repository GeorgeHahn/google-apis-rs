You can change the directory used to store configuration with the \n--config-dir\n flag on a per-invocation basis.\n\n\nMore information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMost APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the \nscope\n determines the \nset of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/drive3-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/drive3-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \ndrive\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \ndrive3 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nComment:\n  anchor: string\n  author:\n    display-name: string\n    email-address: string\n    kind: string\n    me: boolean\n    permission-id: string\n    photo-link: string\n  content: string\n  created-time: string\n  deleted: boolean\n  html-content: string\n  id: string\n  kind: string\n  modified-time: string\n  quoted-file-content:\n    mime-type: string\n    value: string\n  resolved: boolean\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .    anchor=eirmod\n\n\nA region of the document represented as a JSON string. See anchor documentation for details on how to define and interpret anchor properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nauthor    display-name=elitr\n\n\nA plain text displayable name for this user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nemail-address=amet\n\n\nThe email address of the user.

This field is used for setting the content, while htmlContent should be displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncreated-time=aliquyam\n\n\nThe time at which the comment was created (RFC 3339 date-time).\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndeleted=false\n\n\nWhether the comment has been deleted. A deleted comment has no content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhtml-content=lorem\n\n\nThe content of the comment with HTML formatting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid=sea\n\n\nThe ID of the comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkind=et\n\n\nIdentifies what kind of resource this is.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that \n-p\n is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this \n-p k1=v1 k2=v2\n even though the listing below repeats the\n\n-p\n for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p ignore-default-visibility=boolean\n\n\n\n\nWhether to ignore the domain\ns default visibility settings for the created file. Domain administrators can choose to make all uploaded files visible to the domain by default; this parameter bypasses that behavior for the request. Permissions are still inherited from parent folders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p supports-team-drives=boolean\n\n\n\n\nWhether the requesting application supports Team Drives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p ocr-language=string\n\n\n\n\nA language hint for OCR processing during image import (ISO 639-1 code).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p keep-revision-forever=boolean\n\n\n\n\nWhether to set the \nkeepForever\n field in the new head revision.

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nRequired Upload Flags\n\n\nThis method supports the upload of data, which \nrequires\n all of the following flags to be set:\n\n\n\n\n-u (simple|resumable)\n\n\nsimple\n - Upload media all at once.\n\n\nresumable\n - Upload media in a resumable fashion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-f file\n\n\nPath to file to upload.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nRequired Upload Flags\n\n\nThis method supports the upload of data, which \nrequires\n all of the following flags to be set:\n\n\n\n\n-u (simple|resumable)\n\n\nsimple\n - Upload media all at once.\n\n\nresumable\n - Upload media in a resumable fashion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-f file\n\n\nPath to file to upload. It must be seekable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following flag \nmay\n be set: \n\n\n\n\n-m mime\n\n\nthe mime type, like 'application/octet-stream', which is the default\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that \n-p\n is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this \n-p k1=v1 k2=v2\n even though the listing below repeats the\n\n-p\n for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p use-content-as-indexable-text=boolean\n\n\n\n\nWhether to use the uploaded content as indexable text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p remove-parents=string\n\n\n\n\nA comma-separated list of parent IDs to remove.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p ocr-language=string\n\n\n\n\nA language hint for OCR processing during image import (ISO 639-1 code).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p supports-team-drives=boolean\n\n\n\n\nWhether the requesting application supports Team Drives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p keep-revision-forever=boolean\n\n\n\n\nWhether to set the \nkeepForever\n field in the new head revision.

For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. .

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nTeamDrive:\n  background-image-file:\n    id: string\n    width: number\n    x-coordinate: number\n    y-coordinate: number\n  background-image-link: string\n  capabilities:\n    can-add-children: boolean\n    can-change-team-drive-background: boolean\n    can-comment: boolean\n    can-copy: boolean\n    can-delete-team-drive: boolean\n    can-download: boolean\n    can-edit: boolean\n    can-list-children: boolean\n    can-manage-members: boolean\n    can-read-revisions: boolean\n    can-remove-children: boolean\n    can-rename: boolean\n    can-rename-team-drive: boolean\n    can-share: boolean\n  color-rgb: string\n  created-time: string\n  id: string\n  kind: string\n  name: string\n  theme-id: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .background-image-file    id=gubergren\n\n\nThe ID of an image file in Drive to use for the background image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwidth=0.465606723652\n\n\nThe width of the cropped image in the closed range of 0 to 1. This value represents the width of the cropped image divided by the width of the entire image. The height is computed by applying a width to height aspect ratio of 80 to 9. The resulting image must be at least 1280 pixels wide and 144 pixels high.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx-coordinate=0.9995102253\n\n\nThe X coordinate of the upper left corner of the cropping area in the background image.

The set of possible teamDriveThemes can be retrieved from a drive.about.get response. When not specified on a drive.teamdrives.create request, a random theme is chosen from which the background image and color are set. This is a write-only field; it can only be set on requests that don\nt set colorRgb or backgroundImageFile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

This value represents the width of the cropped image divided by the width of the entire image. The height is computed by applying a width to height aspect ratio of 80 to 9. The resulting image must be at least 1280 pixels wide and 144 pixels high.    x-coordinate=0.9995102253  The X coordinate of the upper left corner of the cropping area in the background image. This is a value in the closed range of 0 to 1. This value represents the horizontal distance from the left side of the entire image to the left side of the cropping area divided by the width of the entire image.     y-coordinate=0.527218307679   The Y coordinate of the upper left corner of the cropping area in the background image. This is a value in the closed range of 0 to 1. This value represents the vertical distance from the top side of the entire image to the top side of the cropping area divided by the height of the entire image.     ..    background-image-link=sanctus   A short-lived link to this Team Drive s background image.    capabilities    can-add-children=false  Whether the current user can add children to folders in this Team Drive.    can-change-team-drive-background=true  Whether the current user can change the background of this Team Drive.    can-comment=true  Whether the current user can comment on files in this Team Drive.    can-copy=true  Whether the current user can copy files in this Team Drive.    can-delete-team-drive=false  Whether the current user can delete this Team Drive. Attempting to delete the Team Drive may still fail if there are untrashed items inside the Team Drive.    can-download=true  Whether the current user can download files in this Team Drive.    can-edit=true  Whether the current user can edit files in this Team Drive    can-list-children=true  Whether the current user can list the children of folders in this Team Drive.    can-manage-members=false  Whether the current user can add members to this Team Drive or remove them or change their role.    can-read-revisions=false  Whether the current user can read the revisions resource of files in this Team Drive.    can-remove-children=true  Whether the current user can remove children from folders in this Team Drive.    can-rename=true  Whether the current user can rename files or folders in this Team Drive.    can-rename-team-drive=true  Whether the current user can rename this Team Drive.     can-share=false   Whether the current user can share files or folders in this Team Drive.     ..    color-rgb=duo   The color of this Team Drive as an RGB hex string. It can only be set on a drive.teamdrives.update request that does not set themeId.    created-time=tempor  The time at which the Team Drive was created (RFC 3339 date-time).    id=consetetur  The ID of this Team Drive which is also the ID of the top level folder for this Team Drive.    kind=eirmod  Identifies what kind of resource this is. Value: the fixed string  drive#teamDrive .    name=aliquyam  The name of this Team Drive.    theme-id=no  The ID of the theme from which the background image and color will be set. The set of possible teamDriveThemes can be retrieved from a drive.about.get response. When not specified on a drive.teamdrives.create request, a random theme is chosen from which the background image and color are set.

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. .

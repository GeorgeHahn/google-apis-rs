You can change the directory used to store configuration with the \n--config-dir\n flag on a per-invocation basis.\n\n\nMore information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMost APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the \nscope\n determines the \nset of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/youtube3-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/youtube3-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \nyoutube\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \nyoutube3 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.  If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as  JSON  in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g.  ~/.google-service-cli/youtube3-token- scope-hash .json .

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

This property is only present if the state property\ns value is failed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nis-auto-synced=false\n\n\nIndicates whether YouTube synchronized the caption track to the audio track in the video. The value will be true if a sync was explicitly requested when the caption track was uploaded. For example, when calling the captions.insert or captions.update methods, you can set the sync parameter to true to instruct YouTube to sync the uploaded track to the video. If the value is false, YouTube uses the time codes in the uploaded caption track to determine when to display captions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nis-cc=true\n\n\nIndicates whether the track contains closed captions for the deaf and hard of hearing. The default value is false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nis-draft=true\n\n\nIndicates whether the caption track is a draft. If the value is true, then the track is not publicly visible.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level.

Set the brandingSettings.image.bannerExternalUrl property\ns value to the URL obtained in step 2.\n\n\n\n\nScopes\n\n\nYou will need authorization for at least one of the following scopes to make a valid call:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube\n\n\nhttps://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.force-ssl\n\n\nhttps://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.upload\n\n\n\n\nIf unset, the scope for this method defaults to \nhttps://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube\n.\nYou can set the scope for this method like this: \nyoutube3 --scope \nscope\n channel-banners insert ...\n\n\nRequired Request Value\n\n\nThe request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nChannelBannerResource:\n  etag: string\n  kind: string\n  url: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order.

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call.

This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and get access to all their video and channel data, without having to provide authentication credentials for each individual channel.

Note: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.\n\n\nThe onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel parameter specifies the YouTube channel ID of the channel to which a video is being added. This parameter is required when a request specifies a value for the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter, and it can only be used in conjunction with that parameter. In addition, the request must be authorized using a CMS account that is linked to the content owner that the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter specifies. Finally, the channel that the onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel parameter value specifies must be linked to the content owner that the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter specifies.\n\n\nThis parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and perform actions on behalf of the channel specified in the parameter value, without having to provide authentication credentials for each separate channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that \n-p\n is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this \n-p k1=v1 k2=v2\n even though the listing below repeats the\n\n-p\n for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n-p on-behalf-of-content-owner=string\n\n\nThe onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter indicates that the authenticated user is acting on behalf of the content owner specified in the parameter value. This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and get access to all their video and channel data, without having to provide authentication credentials for each individual channel. The actual CMS account that the user authenticates with needs to be linked to the specified YouTube content owner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p oauth-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth 2.0 token for the current user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p pretty-print=boolean\n\n\n\n\nReturns response with indentations and line breaks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p quota-user=string\n\n\n\n\nAn opaque string that represents a user for quota purposes. Must not exceed 40 characters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p user-ip=string\n\n\n\n\nDeprecated. Please use quotaUser instead.",

For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

The ingestion URL of the closed captions is returned through the liveStreams API. This is mutually exclusive with using the closed_captions_type property, and is equivalent to setting closed_captions_type to CLOSED_CAPTIONS_HTTP_POST.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenable-content-encryption=true\n\n\nThis setting indicates whether YouTube should enable content encryption for the broadcast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenable-dvr=true\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis setting determines whether viewers can access DVR controls while watching the video. DVR controls enable the viewer to control the video playback experience by pausing, rewinding, or fast forwarding content. The default value for this property is true.\n\n\nImportant: You must set the value to true and also set the enableArchive property\ns value to true if you want to make playback available immediately after the broadcast ends.\n\n \nenable-embed=true\n\n    - This setting indicates whether the broadcast video can be played in an embedded player.

If the monitor stream is enabled, then YouTube will broadcast the event content on a special stream intended only for the broadcaster\ns consumption. The broadcaster can use the stream to review the event content and also to identify the optimal times to insert cuepoints.\n\n\nYou need to set this value to true if you intend to have a broadcast delay for your event.\n\n\nNote: This property cannot be updated once the broadcast is in the testing or live state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    projection=sea\n\n\n\n\nThe projection format of this broadcast.

If you set this property\ns value to true but do not also set the enableDvr property to true, there may be a delay of around one day before the archived video will be available for playback.\n\n \nstart-with-slate=false\n\n    - This setting indicates whether the broadcast should automatically begin with an in-stream slate when you update the broadcast\ns status to live. After updating the status, you then need to send a liveCuepoints.insert request that sets the cuepoint\ns eventState to end to remove the in-stream slate and make your broadcast stream visible to viewers.\n\n \nstereo-layout=magna\n\n    - No description provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    etag=ut\n\n\n\n\nEtag of this resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid=amet\n\n\nThe ID that YouTube assigns to uniquely identify the broadcast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkind=sed\n\n\nIdentifies what kind of resource this is.

Note that the broadcast represents exactly one YouTube video. You can set this field by modifying the broadcast resource or by setting the title field of the corresponding video resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..statistics    concurrent-viewers=clita\n\n\n\n\nThe number of viewers currently watching the broadcast. The property and its value will be present if the broadcast has current viewers and the broadcast owner has not hidden the viewcount for the video. Note that YouTube stops tracking the number of concurrent viewers for a broadcast when the broadcast ends. So, this property would not identify the number of viewers watching an archived video of a live broadcast that already ended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntotal-chat-count=-62\n\n\n\n\nThe total number of live chat messages currently on the broadcast. The property and its value will be present if the broadcast is public, has the live chat feature enabled, and has at least one message. Note that this field will not be filled after the broadcast ends. So this property would not identify the number of chat messages for an archived video of a completed live broadcast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..status    life-cycle-status=elitr\n\n\n\n\nThe broadcast\ns status. The status can be updated using the API\ns liveBroadcasts.transition method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlive-broadcast-priority=et\n\n\nPriority of the live broadcast event (internal state).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprivacy-status=vero\n\n\nThe broadcast\ns privacy status. Note that the broadcast represents exactly one YouTube video, so the privacy settings are identical to those supported for videos. In addition, you can set this field by modifying the broadcast resource or by setting the privacyStatus field of the corresponding video resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrecording-status=sadipscing\n\n\nThe broadcast\ns recording status.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that \n-p\n is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this \n-p k1=v1 k2=v2\n even though the listing below repeats the\n\n-p\n for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p on-behalf-of-content-owner=string\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.\n\n\nThe onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter indicates that the request\ns authorization credentials identify a YouTube CMS user who is acting on behalf of the content owner specified in the parameter value. This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and get access to all their video and channel data, without having to provide authentication credentials for each individual channel. The CMS account that the user authenticates with must be linked to the specified YouTube content owner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p on-behalf-of-content-owner-channel=string\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis parameter can only be used in a properly authorized request. Note: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.\n\n\nThe onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel parameter specifies the YouTube channel ID of the channel to which a video is being added. This parameter is required when a request specifies a value for the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter, and it can only be used in conjunction with that parameter. In addition, the request must be authorized using a CMS account that is linked to the content owner that the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter specifies. Finally, the channel that the onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel parameter value specifies must be linked to the content owner that the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter specifies.\n\n\nThis parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and perform actions on behalf of the channel specified in the parameter value, without having to provide authentication credentials for each separate channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

The ingestion URL of the closed captions is returned through the liveStreams API. This is mutually exclusive with using the closed_captions_type property, and is equivalent to setting closed_captions_type to CLOSED_CAPTIONS_HTTP_POST.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenable-content-encryption=false\n\n\nThis setting indicates whether YouTube should enable content encryption for the broadcast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenable-dvr=true\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis setting determines whether viewers can access DVR controls while watching the video. DVR controls enable the viewer to control the video playback experience by pausing, rewinding, or fast forwarding content. The default value for this property is true.\n\n\nImportant: You must set the value to true and also set the enableArchive property\ns value to true if you want to make playback available immediately after the broadcast ends.\n\n \nenable-embed=true\n\n    - This setting indicates whether the broadcast video can be played in an embedded player.

If the monitor stream is enabled, then YouTube will broadcast the event content on a special stream intended only for the broadcaster\ns consumption. The broadcaster can use the stream to review the event content and also to identify the optimal times to insert cuepoints.\n\n\nYou need to set this value to true if you intend to have a broadcast delay for your event.\n\n\nNote: This property cannot be updated once the broadcast is in the testing or live state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    projection=justo\n\n\n\n\nThe projection format of this broadcast.

If you set this property\ns value to true but do not also set the enableDvr property to true, there may be a delay of around one day before the archived video will be available for playback.\n\n \nstart-with-slate=false\n\n    - This setting indicates whether the broadcast should automatically begin with an in-stream slate when you update the broadcast\ns status to live. After updating the status, you then need to send a liveCuepoints.insert request that sets the cuepoint\ns eventState to end to remove the in-stream slate and make your broadcast stream visible to viewers.\n\n \nstereo-layout=ipsum\n\n    - No description provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    etag=eos\n\n\n\n\nEtag of this resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid=nonumy\n\n\nThe ID that YouTube assigns to uniquely identify the broadcast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkind=sanctus\n\n\nIdentifies what kind of resource this is.

Note that the broadcast represents exactly one YouTube video. You can set this field by modifying the broadcast resource or by setting the title field of the corresponding video resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..statistics    concurrent-viewers=eirmod\n\n\n\n\nThe number of viewers currently watching the broadcast. The property and its value will be present if the broadcast has current viewers and the broadcast owner has not hidden the viewcount for the video. Note that YouTube stops tracking the number of concurrent viewers for a broadcast when the broadcast ends. So, this property would not identify the number of viewers watching an archived video of a live broadcast that already ended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntotal-chat-count=-14\n\n\n\n\nThe total number of live chat messages currently on the broadcast. The property and its value will be present if the broadcast is public, has the live chat feature enabled, and has at least one message. Note that this field will not be filled after the broadcast ends. So this property would not identify the number of chat messages for an archived video of a completed live broadcast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..status    life-cycle-status=sea\n\n\n\n\nThe broadcast\ns status. The status can be updated using the API\ns liveBroadcasts.transition method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlive-broadcast-priority=sanctus\n\n\nPriority of the live broadcast event (internal state).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprivacy-status=gubergren\n\n\nThe broadcast\ns privacy status. Note that the broadcast represents exactly one YouTube video, so the privacy settings are identical to those supported for videos. In addition, you can set this field by modifying the broadcast resource or by setting the privacyStatus field of the corresponding video resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrecording-status=est\n\n\nThe broadcast\ns recording status.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that \n-p\n is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this \n-p k1=v1 k2=v2\n even though the listing below repeats the\n\n-p\n for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p on-behalf-of-content-owner=string\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.\n\n\nThe onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter indicates that the request\ns authorization credentials identify a YouTube CMS user who is acting on behalf of the content owner specified in the parameter value. This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and get access to all their video and channel data, without having to provide authentication credentials for each individual channel. The CMS account that the user authenticates with must be linked to the specified YouTube content owner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p on-behalf-of-content-owner-channel=string\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis parameter can only be used in a properly authorized request. Note: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.\n\n\nThe onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel parameter specifies the YouTube channel ID of the channel to which a video is being added. This parameter is required when a request specifies a value for the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter, and it can only be used in conjunction with that parameter. In addition, the request must be authorized using a CMS account that is linked to the content owner that the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter specifies. Finally, the channel that the onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel parameter value specifies must be linked to the content owner that the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter specifies.\n\n\nThis parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and perform actions on behalf of the channel specified in the parameter value, without having to provide authentication credentials for each separate channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

The onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter indicates that the request s authorization credentials identify a YouTube CMS user who is acting on behalf of the content owner specified in the parameter value. This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and get access to all their video and channel data, without having to provide authentication credentials for each individual channel. The CMS account that the user authenticates with must be linked to the specified YouTube content owner.      -p related-to-video-id=string   The relatedToVideoId parameter retrieves a list of videos that are related to the video that the parameter value identifies. The parameter value must be set to a YouTube video ID and, if you are using this parameter, the type parameter must be set to video.     -p page-token=string   The pageToken parameter identifies a specific page in the result set that should be returned. In an API response, the nextPageToken and prevPageToken properties identify other pages that could be retrieved.     -p q=string    The q parameter specifies the query term to search for.  Your request can also use the Boolean NOT (-) and OR (|) operators to exclude videos or to find videos that are associated with one of several search terms. For example, to search for videos matching either  boating  or  sailing , set the q parameter value to boating|sailing. Similarly, to search for videos matching either  boating  or  sailing  but not  fishing , set the q parameter value to boating|sailing -fishing. Note that the pipe character must be URL-escaped when it is sent in your API request. The URL-escaped value for the pipe character is %7C.      -p channel-id=string   The channelId parameter indicates that the API response should only contain resources created by the channel     -p video-definition=string   The videoDefinition parameter lets you restrict a search to only include either high definition (HD) or standard definition (SD) videos. HD videos are available for playback in at least 720p, though higher resolutions, like 1080p, might also be available. If you specify a value for this parameter, you must also set the type parameter s value to video.     -p video-dimension=string   The videoDimension parameter lets you restrict a search to only retrieve 2D or 3D videos. If you specify a value for this parameter, you must also set the type parameter s value to video.",

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nRequired Upload Flags\n\n\nThis method supports the upload of data, which \nrequires\n all of the following flags to be set:\n\n\n\n\n-u (simple|resumable)\n\n\nsimple\n - Upload media all at once.\n\n\nresumable\n - Upload media in a resumable fashion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-f file\n\n\nPath to file to upload.

Note: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.\n\n\nThe onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel parameter specifies the YouTube channel ID of the channel to which a video is being added. This parameter is required when a request specifies a value for the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter, and it can only be used in conjunction with that parameter. In addition, the request must be authorized using a CMS account that is linked to the content owner that the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter specifies. Finally, the channel that the onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel parameter value specifies must be linked to the content owner that the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter specifies.\n\n\nThis parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and perform actions on behalf of the channel specified in the parameter value, without having to provide authentication credentials for each separate channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p auto-levels=boolean\n\n\n\n\nThe autoLevels parameter indicates whether YouTube should automatically enhance the video\ns lighting and color.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p on-behalf-of-content-owner=string\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.\n\n\nThe onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter indicates that the request\ns authorization credentials identify a YouTube CMS user who is acting on behalf of the content owner specified in the parameter value.

The CMS account that the user authenticates with must be linked to the specified YouTube content owner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p stabilize=boolean\n\n\n\n\nThe stabilize parameter indicates whether YouTube should adjust the video to remove shaky camera motions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p notify-subscribers=boolean\n\n\n\n\nThe notifySubscribers parameter indicates whether YouTube should send a notification about the new video to users who subscribe to the video\ns channel. A parameter value of True indicates that subscribers will be notified of newly uploaded videos. However, a channel owner who is uploading many videos might prefer to set the value to False to avoid sending a notification about each new video to the channel\ns subscribers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

You can retrieve information about each topic using the Freebase Topic API.\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that \n-p\n is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this \n-p k1=v1 k2=v2\n even though the listing below repeats the\n\n-p\n for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n-p on-behalf-of-content-owner=string\n\n\n\n\nNote: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.\n\n\nThe onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter indicates that the request\ns authorization credentials identify a YouTube CMS user who is acting on behalf of the content owner specified in the parameter value. This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and get access to all their video and channel data, without having to provide authentication credentials for each individual channel. The actual CMS account that the user authenticates with must be linked to the specified YouTube content owner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

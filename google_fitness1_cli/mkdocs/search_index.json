No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/fitness1-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \nfitness\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \nfitness1 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

Use me to indicate the authenticated user. Only me is supported at this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired Request Value\n\n\nThe request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nDataSource:\n  application:\n    details-url: string\n    name: string\n    package-name: string\n    version: string\n  data-stream-id: string\n  data-stream-name: string\n  data-type:\n    name: string\n  device:\n    manufacturer: string\n    model: string\n    type: string\n    uid: string\n    version: string\n  name: string\n  type: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .application    details-url=eirmod\n\n\nAn optional URI that can be used to link back to the application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname=sit\n\n\nThe name of this application. This is required for REST clients, but we do not enforce uniqueness of this name. It is provided as a matter of convenience for other developers who would like to identify which REST created an Application or Data Source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npackage-name=stet\n\n\nPackage name for this application. This is used as a unique identifier when created by Android applications, but cannot be specified by REST clients. REST clients will have their developer project number reflected into the Data Source data stream IDs, instead of the packageName.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nversion=sed\n\n\n\n\nVersion of the application. You should update this field whenever the application changes in a way that affects the computation of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    data-stream-id=et\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA unique identifier for the data stream produced by this data source. The identifier includes:\n\n\n\n\nThe physical device\ns manufacturer, model, and serial number (UID). \n\n\nThe application\ns package name or name. Package name is used when the data source was created by an Android application. The developer project number is used when the data source was created by a REST client. \n\n\nThe data source\ns type. \n\n\nThe data source\ns stream name.  Note that not all attributes of the data source are used as part of the stream identifier. In particular, the version of the hardware/the application isn\nt used. This allows us to preserve the same stream through version updates. This also means that two DataSource objects may represent the same data stream even if they\nre not equal.\n\n\n\n\nThe exact format of the data stream ID created by an Android application is: type:dataType.name:application.packageName:device.manufacturer:device.model:device.uid:dataStreamName \n\n\nThe exact format of the data stream ID created by a REST client is: type:dataType.name:developer project number:device.manufacturer:device.model:device.uid:dataStreamName \n\n\nWhen any of the optional fields that comprise of the data stream ID are blank, they will be omitted from the data stream ID. The minnimum viable data stream ID would be: type:dataType.name:developer project number\n\n\nFinally, the developer project number is obfuscated when read by any REST or Android client that did not create the data source. Only the data source creator will see the developer project number in clear and normal form.\n\n \ndata-stream-name=dolores\n\n    - The stream name uniquely identifies this particular data source among other data sources of the same type from the same underlying producer. Setting the stream name is optional, but should be done whenever an application exposes two streams for the same data type, or when a device has two equivalent sensors.\n\n \ndata-type    name=kasd\n\n    - Each data type has a unique, namespaced, name. All data types in the com.google namespace are shared as part of the platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..device    manufacturer=accusam\n\n\n\n\nManufacturer of the product/hardware.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel=takimata\n\n\nEnd-user visible model name for the device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntype=justo\n\n\nA constant representing the type of the device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuid=amet.\n\n\nThe serial number or other unique ID for the hardware. This field is obfuscated when read by any REST or Android client that did not create the data source. Only the data source creator will see the uid field in clear and normal form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nversion=erat\n\n\n\n\nVersion string for the device hardware/software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    name=labore\n\n\n\n\nAn end-user visible name for this data source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntype=sea\n\n\nA constant describing the type of this data source. Indicates whether this data source produces raw or derived data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p oauth-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth 2.0 token for the current user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p pretty-print=boolean\n\n\n\n\nReturns response with indentations and line breaks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p quota-user=string\n\n\n\n\nAvailable to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters. Overrides userIp if both are provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p user-ip=string\n\n\n\n\nIP address of the site where the request originates. Use this if you want to enforce per-user limits.",

The minnimum viable data stream ID would be: type:dataType.name:developer project number  Finally, the developer project number is obfuscated when read by any REST or Android client that did not create the data source. Only the data source creator will see the developer project number in clear and normal form.   data-stream-name=dolores \n    - The stream name uniquely identifies this particular data source among other data sources of the same type from the same underlying producer. Setting the stream name is optional, but should be done whenever an application exposes two streams for the same data type, or when a device has two equivalent sensors.   data-type    name=kasd \n    - Each data type has a unique, namespaced, name. All data types in the com.google namespace are shared as part of the platform.      ..device    manufacturer=accusam   Manufacturer of the product/hardware.    model=takimata  End-user visible model name for the device.    type=justo  A constant representing the type of the device.    uid=amet.  The serial number or other unique ID for the hardware. This field is obfuscated when read by any REST or Android client that did not create the data source. Only the data source creator will see the uid field in clear and normal form.     version=erat   Version string for the device hardware/software.     ..    name=labore   An end-user visible name for this data source.    type=sea  A constant describing the type of this data source. Indicates whether this data source produces raw or derived data.     About Cursors  The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:   The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the  .  character. Fields can be nested such as in  -r f.s.o  .  The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. . Each additional  .  moves it up one additional level. E.g.  ...  would go three levels up.",

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.  For example, a structure like this:  Dataset:\n  data-source-id: string\n  max-end-time-ns: string\n  min-start-time-ns: string\n  next-page-token: string  can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.   -r .    data-source-id=nonumy  The data stream ID of the data source that created the points in this dataset.    max-end-time-ns=dolores  The largest end time of all data points in this possibly partial representation of the dataset. Time is in nanoseconds from epoch. This should also match the first part of the dataset identifier.    min-start-time-ns=gubergren  The smallest start time of all data points in this possibly partial representation of the dataset. Time is in nanoseconds from epoch. This should also match the first part of the dataset identifier.    next-page-token=sadipscing  This token will be set when a dataset is received in response to a GET request and the dataset is too large to be included in a single response. Provide this value in a subsequent GET request to return the next page of data points within this dataset.     About Cursors  The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:   The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the  .  character. Fields can be nested such as in  -r f.s.o  .  The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. . Each additional  .  moves it up one additional level. E.g.  ...  would go three levels up.",

It is provided as a matter of convenience for other developers who would like to identify which REST created an Application or Data Source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npackage-name=no\n\n\nPackage name for this application. This is used as a unique identifier when created by Android applications, but cannot be specified by REST clients. REST clients will have their developer project number reflected into the Data Source data stream IDs, instead of the packageName.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nversion=justo\n\n\n\n\nVersion of the application. You should update this field whenever the application changes in a way that affects the computation of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    data-stream-id=justo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA unique identifier for the data stream produced by this data source. The identifier includes:\n\n\n\n\nThe physical device\ns manufacturer, model, and serial number (UID). \n\n\nThe application\ns package name or name. Package name is used when the data source was created by an Android application. The developer project number is used when the data source was created by a REST client. \n\n\nThe data source\ns type. \n\n\nThe data source\ns stream name.  Note that not all attributes of the data source are used as part of the stream identifier. In particular, the version of the hardware/the application isn\nt used. This allows us to preserve the same stream through version updates. This also means that two DataSource objects may represent the same data stream even if they\nre not equal.\n\n\n\n\nThe exact format of the data stream ID created by an Android application is: type:dataType.name:application.packageName:device.manufacturer:device.model:device.uid:dataStreamName \n\n\nThe exact format of the data stream ID created by a REST client is: type:dataType.name:developer project number:device.manufacturer:device.model:device.uid:dataStreamName \n\n\nWhen any of the optional fields that comprise of the data stream ID are blank, they will be omitted from the data stream ID. The minnimum viable data stream ID would be: type:dataType.name:developer project number\n\n\nFinally, the developer project number is obfuscated when read by any REST or Android client that did not create the data source. Only the data source creator will see the developer project number in clear and normal form.\n\n \ndata-stream-name=et\n\n    - The stream name uniquely identifies this particular data source among other data sources of the same type from the same underlying producer. Setting the stream name is optional, but should be done whenever an application exposes two streams for the same data type, or when a device has two equivalent sensors.\n\n \ndata-type    name=et\n\n    - Each data type has a unique, namespaced, name.

Indicates whether this data source produces raw or derived data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

This allows us to preserve the same stream through version updates. This also means that two DataSource objects may represent the same data stream even if they re not equal.   The exact format of the data stream ID created by an Android application is: type:dataType.name:application.packageName:device.manufacturer:device.model:device.uid:dataStreamName   The exact format of the data stream ID created by a REST client is: type:dataType.name:developer project number:device.manufacturer:device.model:device.uid:dataStreamName   When any of the optional fields that comprise of the data stream ID are blank, they will be omitted from the data stream ID. The minnimum viable data stream ID would be: type:dataType.name:developer project number  Finally, the developer project number is obfuscated when read by any REST or Android client that did not create the data source. Only the data source creator will see the developer project number in clear and normal form.   data-stream-name=eirmod \n    - The stream name uniquely identifies this particular data source among other data sources of the same type from the same underlying producer. Setting the stream name is optional, but should be done whenever an application exposes two streams for the same data type, or when a device has two equivalent sensors.   data-type    name=elitr \n    - Each data type has a unique, namespaced, name. All data types in the com.google namespace are shared as part of the platform.      ..device    manufacturer=amet   Manufacturer of the product/hardware.    model=no  End-user visible model name for the device.    type=labore  A constant representing the type of the device.    uid=eirmod  The serial number or other unique ID for the hardware. This field is obfuscated when read by any REST or Android client that did not create the data source. Only the data source creator will see the uid field in clear and normal form.     version=dolore   Version string for the device hardware/software.     ..    name=invidunt   An end-user visible name for this data source.    type=aliquyam  A constant describing the type of this data source. Indicates whether this data source produces raw or derived data.     About Cursors  The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:   The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the  .  character. Fields can be nested such as in  -r f.s.o  .  The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. .

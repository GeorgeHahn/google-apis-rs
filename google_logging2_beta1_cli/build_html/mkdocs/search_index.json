You can change the directory used to store configuration with the \n--config-dir\n flag on a per-invocation basis.\n\n\nMore information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMost APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the \nscope\n determines the \nset of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/logging2-beta1-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/logging2-beta1-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \nlogging\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \nlogging2-beta1 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

The forward-slash character (/) denotes a hierarchy of name pieces, and it cannot be the first character of the name.The metric identifier in this field must not be URL-encoded (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding).

The version also dictates the syntax of the filter expression. When a value for this field is missing, the default value of V2 should be assumed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p bearer-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth bearer token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

However, when the metric identifier appears as the [METRIC_ID] part of a metric_name API parameter, then the metric identifier must be URL-encoded. Example:  projects/my-project/metrics/nginx%2Frequests .    version=nonumy  Output only. The API version that created or updated this metric. The version also dictates the syntax of the filter expression. When a value for this field is missing, the default value of V2 should be assumed.",

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nLogSink:\n  destination: string\n  end-time: string\n  filter: string\n  name: string\n  output-version-format: string\n  start-time: string\n  writer-identity: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .    destination=ipsum\n\n\nRequired. The export destination:\n    \nstorage.googleapis.com/[GCS_BUCKET]\n\n    \nbigquery.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/datasets/[DATASET]\n\n    \npubsub.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/topics/[TOPIC_ID]\n\n    The sink\ns writer_identity, set when the sink is created, must have permission to write to the destination or else the log entries are not exported. For more information, see Exporting Logs With Sinks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nend-time=lorem\n\n\nOptional. The time at which this sink will stop exporting log entries. Log entries are exported only if their timestamp is earlier than the end time. If this field is not supplied, there is no end time. If both a start time and an end time are provided, then the end time must be later than the start time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfilter=et\n\n\n\n\nOptional. An advanced logs filter. The only exported log entries are those that are in the resource owning the sink and that match the filter. The filter must use the log entry format specified by the output_version_format parameter. For example, in the v2 format:\n    logName=\nprojects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]\n AND severity\n=ERROR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname=duo\n\n\n\n\nRequired. The client-assigned sink identifier, unique within the project. Example: \nmy-syslog-errors-to-pubsub\n. Sink identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: upper and lower-case alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, and periods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\noutput-version-format=aliquyam\n\n\nOptional. The log entry format to use for this sink\ns exported log entries. The v2 format is used by default. The v1 format is deprecated and should be used only as part of a migration effort to v2. See Migration to the v2 API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstart-time=sea\n\n\nOptional. The time at which this sink will begin exporting log entries. Log entries are exported only if their timestamp is not earlier than the start time. The default value of this field is the time the sink is created or updated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwriter-identity=lorem\n\n\nOutput only. An IAM identity\nmdash;a service account or group\nmdash;under which Stackdriver Logging writes the exported log entries to the sink\ns destination. This field is set by sinks.create and sinks.update, based on the setting of unique_writer_identity in those methods.Until you grant this identity write-access to the destination, log entry exports from this sink will fail. For more information, see Granting access for a resource. Consult the destination service\ns documentation to determine the appropriate IAM roles to assign to the identity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that \n-p\n is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this \n-p k1=v1 k2=v2\n even though the listing below repeats the\n\n-p\n for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n-p unique-writer-identity=boolean\n\n\nOptional. See sinks.create for a description of this field. When updating a sink, the effect of this field on the value of writer_identity in the updated sink depends on both the old and new values of this field:\n    If the old and new values of this field are both false or both true, then there is no change to the sink\ns writer_identity.\n    If the old value was false and the new value is true, then writer_identity is changed to a unique service account.\n    It is an error if the old value was true and the new value is false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p bearer-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth bearer token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p oauth-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth 2.0 token for the current user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p pp=boolean\n\n\n\n\nPretty-print response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p pretty-print=boolean\n\n\n\n\nReturns response with indentations and line breaks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p quota-user=string\n\n\n\n\nAvailable to use for quota purposes for server-side applications.

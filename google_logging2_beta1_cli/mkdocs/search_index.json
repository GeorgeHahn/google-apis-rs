You can change the directory used to store configuration with the \n--config-dir\n flag on a per-invocation basis.\n\n\nMore information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMost APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the \nscope\n determines the \nset of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/logging2-beta1-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/logging2-beta1-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \nlogging\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \nlogging2-beta1 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

A map from a label key string to an extractor expression which is used to extract data from a log entry field and assign as the label value. Each label key specified in the LabelDescriptor must have an associated extractor expression in this map. The syntax of the extractor expression is the same as for the value_extractor field.The extracted value is converted to the type defined in the label descriptor. If the either the extraction or the type conversion fails, the label will have a default value. The default value for a string label is an empty string, for an integer label its 0, and for a boolean label its false.Note that there are upper bounds on the maximum number of labels and the number of active time series that are allowed in a project.\n\n\nthe value will be associated with the given \nkey\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmetric-descriptor    description=justo\n\n\nA detailed description of the metric, which can be used in documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndisplay-name=justo\n\n\nA concise name for the metric, which can be displayed in user interfaces.

The client-assigned metric identifier. Examples: \nerror_count\n, \nnginx/requests\n.Metric identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and the special characters _-.,+!*\n,()%/. The forward-slash character (/) denotes a hierarchy of name pieces, and it cannot be the first character of the name.The metric identifier in this field must not be URL-encoded (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding). However, when the metric identifier appears as the [METRIC_ID] part of a metric_name API parameter, then the metric identifier must be URL-encoded. Example: \nprojects/my-project/metrics/nginx%2Frequests\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvalue-extractor=duo\n\n\nOptional. A value_extractor is required when using a distribution logs-based metric to extract the values to record from a log entry. Two functions are supported for value extraction: EXTRACT(field) or REGEXP_EXTRACT(field, regex). The argument are:  1. field: The name of the log entry field from which the value is to be  extracted.  2. regex: A regular expression using the Google RE2 syntax  (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) with a single capture  group to extract data from the specified log entry field. The value  of the field is converted to a string before applying the regex.  It is an error to specify a regex that does not include exactly one  capture group.The result of the extraction must be convertible to a double type, as the distribution always records double values. If either the extraction or the conversion to double fails, then those values are not recorded in the distribution.Example: REGEXP_EXTRACT(jsonPayload.request, \n.\nquantity=(\\d+).\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nversion=aliquyam\n\n\nDeprecated. The API version that created or updated this metric. The v2 format is used by default and cannot be changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p bearer-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth bearer token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

If the either the extraction or the type conversion fails, the label will have a default value. The default value for a string label is an empty string, for an integer label its 0, and for a boolean label its false.Note that there are upper bounds on the maximum number of labels and the number of active time series that are allowed in a project.  the value will be associated with the given  key    metric-descriptor    description=justo  A detailed description of the metric, which can be used in documentation.    display-name=justo  A concise name for the metric, which can be displayed in user interfaces.

A description of this metric, which is used in documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfilter=amet\n\n\nRequired. An advanced logs filter which is used to match log entries. Example:\n    \nresource.type=gae_app AND severity\n=ERROR\n\n    The maximum length of the filter is 20000 characters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlabel-extractors=key=no\n\n\nOptional. A map from a label key string to an extractor expression which is used to extract data from a log entry field and assign as the label value. Each label key specified in the LabelDescriptor must have an associated extractor expression in this map. The syntax of the extractor expression is the same as for the value_extractor field.The extracted value is converted to the type defined in the label descriptor. If the either the extraction or the type conversion fails, the label will have a default value. The default value for a string label is an empty string, for an integer label its 0, and for a boolean label its false.Note that there are upper bounds on the maximum number of labels and the number of active time series that are allowed in a project.\n\n\nthe value will be associated with the given \nkey\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmetric-descriptor    description=labore\n\n\nA detailed description of the metric, which can be used in documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndisplay-name=eirmod\n\n\nA concise name for the metric, which can be displayed in user interfaces.

The type is not URL-encoded. All user-defined custom metric types have the DNS name custom.googleapis.com. Metric types should use a natural hierarchical grouping. For example:\n    \ncustom.googleapis.com/invoice/paid/amount\n\n    \nappengine.googleapis.com/http/server/response_latencies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nunit=accusam\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe unit in which the metric value is reported. It is only applicable if the value_type is INT64, DOUBLE, or DISTRIBUTION. The supported units are a subset of The Unified Code for Units of Measure (http://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html) standard:Basic units (UNIT)\n    bit bit\n    By byte\n    s second\n    min minute\n    h hour\n    d dayPrefixes (PREFIX)\n    k kilo (10\n3)\n    M mega (10\n6)\n    G giga (10\n9)\n    T tera (10\n12)\n    P peta (10\n15)\n    E exa (10\n18)\n    Z zetta (10\n21)\n    Y yotta (10\n24)\n    m milli (10\n-3)\n    u micro (10\n-6)\n    n nano (10\n-9)\n    p pico (10\n-12)\n    f femto (10\n-15)\n    a atto (10\n-18)\n    z zepto (10\n-21)\n    y yocto (10\n-24)\n    Ki kibi (2\n10)\n    Mi mebi (2\n20)\n    Gi gibi (2\n30)\n    Ti tebi (2\n40)GrammarThe grammar includes the dimensionless unit 1, such as 1/s.The grammar also includes these connectors:\n    / division (as an infix operator, e.g. 1/s).\n    . multiplication (as an infix operator, e.g. GBy.d)The grammar for a unit is as follows:\n    Expression = Component { \n.\n Component } { \n/\n Component } ;\n\n\nComponent = [ PREFIX ] UNIT [ Annotation ]\n          | Annotation\n          | \n1\n\n          ;\n\n\nAnnotation = \n{\n NAME \n}\n ;\nNotes:\nAnnotation is just a comment if it follows a UNIT and is  equivalent to 1 if it is used alone. For examples,  {requests}/s == 1/s, By{transmitted}/s == By/s.\nNAME is a sequence of non-blank printable ASCII characters not  containing \n{\n or \n}\n.\n* \nvalue-type=lorem\n\n    - Whether the measurement is an integer, a floating-point number, etc. Some combinations of metric_kind and value_type might not be supported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    name=sea\n\n\n\n\nRequired. The client-assigned metric identifier. Examples: \nerror_count\n, \nnginx/requests\n.Metric identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and the special characters _-.,+!*\n,()%/. The forward-slash character (/) denotes a hierarchy of name pieces, and it cannot be the first character of the name.The metric identifier in this field must not be URL-encoded (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding). However, when the metric identifier appears as the [METRIC_ID] part of a metric_name API parameter, then the metric identifier must be URL-encoded. Example: \nprojects/my-project/metrics/nginx%2Frequests\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvalue-extractor=et\n\n\nOptional. A value_extractor is required when using a distribution logs-based metric to extract the values to record from a log entry. Two functions are supported for value extraction: EXTRACT(field) or REGEXP_EXTRACT(field, regex). The argument are:  1. field: The name of the log entry field from which the value is to be  extracted.  2. regex: A regular expression using the Google RE2 syntax  (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) with a single capture  group to extract data from the specified log entry field. The value  of the field is converted to a string before applying the regex.  It is an error to specify a regex that does not include exactly one  capture group.The result of the extraction must be convertible to a double type, as the distribution always records double values. If either the extraction or the conversion to double fails, then those values are not recorded in the distribution.Example: REGEXP_EXTRACT(jsonPayload.request, \n.\nquantity=(\\d+).\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nversion=duo\n\n\nDeprecated. The API version that created or updated this metric. The v2 format is used by default and cannot be changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly.

A description of this metric, which is used in documentation.    filter=amet  Required. An advanced logs filter which is used to match log entries. Example:\n     resource.type=gae_app AND severity =ERROR \n    The maximum length of the filter is 20000 characters.    label-extractors=key=no  Optional. A map from a label key string to an extractor expression which is used to extract data from a log entry field and assign as the label value. Each label key specified in the LabelDescriptor must have an associated extractor expression in this map. The syntax of the extractor expression is the same as for the value_extractor field.The extracted value is converted to the type defined in the label descriptor. If the either the extraction or the type conversion fails, the label will have a default value. The default value for a string label is an empty string, for an integer label its 0, and for a boolean label its false.Note that there are upper bounds on the maximum number of labels and the number of active time series that are allowed in a project.  the value will be associated with the given  key    metric-descriptor    description=labore  A detailed description of the metric, which can be used in documentation.    display-name=eirmod  A concise name for the metric, which can be displayed in user interfaces. Use sentence case without an ending period, for example  Request count . This field is optional but it is recommended to be set for any metrics associated with user-visible concepts, such as Quota.    metric-kind=dolore  Whether the metric records instantaneous values, changes to a value, etc. Some combinations of metric_kind and value_type might not be supported.    name=invidunt  The resource name of the metric descriptor.     type=aliquyam   The metric type, including its DNS name prefix. The type is not URL-encoded. All user-defined custom metric types have the DNS name custom.googleapis.com. Metric types should use a natural hierarchical grouping. For example:\n     custom.googleapis.com/invoice/paid/amount \n     appengine.googleapis.com/http/server/response_latencies     unit=accusam    The unit in which the metric value is reported. It is only applicable if the value_type is INT64, DOUBLE, or DISTRIBUTION. The supported units are a subset of The Unified Code for Units of Measure (http://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html) standard:Basic units (UNIT)\n    bit bit\n    By byte\n    s second\n    min minute\n    h hour\n    d dayPrefixes (PREFIX)\n    k kilo (10 3)\n    M mega (10 6)\n    G giga (10 9)\n    T tera (10 12)\n    P peta (10 15)\n    E exa (10 18)\n    Z zetta (10 21)\n    Y yotta (10 24)\n    m milli (10 -3)\n    u micro (10 -6)\n    n nano (10 -9)\n    p pico (10 -12)\n    f femto (10 -15)\n    a atto (10 -18)\n    z zepto (10 -21)\n    y yocto (10 -24)\n    Ki kibi (2 10)\n    Mi mebi (2 20)\n    Gi gibi (2 30)\n    Ti tebi (2 40)GrammarThe grammar includes the dimensionless unit 1, such as 1/s.The grammar also includes these connectors:\n    / division (as an infix operator, e.g. 1/s).\n    . multiplication (as an infix operator, e.g. GBy.d)The grammar for a unit is as follows:\n    Expression = Component {  .

For examples,  {requests}/s == 1/s, By{transmitted}/s == By/s.\nNAME is a sequence of non-blank printable ASCII characters not  containing  {  or  } .\n*  value-type=lorem \n    - Whether the measurement is an integer, a floating-point number, etc. Some combinations of metric_kind and value_type might not be supported.      ..    name=sea   Required. The client-assigned metric identifier. Examples:  error_count ,  nginx/requests .Metric identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and the special characters _-.,+!* ,()%/. The forward-slash character (/) denotes a hierarchy of name pieces, and it cannot be the first character of the name.The metric identifier in this field must not be URL-encoded (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding). However, when the metric identifier appears as the [METRIC_ID] part of a metric_name API parameter, then the metric identifier must be URL-encoded. Example:  projects/my-project/metrics/nginx%2Frequests .    value-extractor=et  Optional. A value_extractor is required when using a distribution logs-based metric to extract the values to record from a log entry. Two functions are supported for value extraction: EXTRACT(field) or REGEXP_EXTRACT(field, regex). The argument are:  1. field: The name of the log entry field from which the value is to be  extracted.  2. regex: A regular expression using the Google RE2 syntax  (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) with a single capture  group to extract data from the specified log entry field. The value  of the field is converted to a string before applying the regex.  It is an error to specify a regex that does not include exactly one  capture group.The result of the extraction must be convertible to a double type, as the distribution always records double values. If either the extraction or the conversion to double fails, then those values are not recorded in the distribution.Example: REGEXP_EXTRACT(jsonPayload.request,  . quantity=(\\d+). )    version=duo  Deprecated.

To only export entries from certain child projects, filter on the project part of the log name:\n    logName:( projects/test-project1/  OR  projects/test-project2/ ) AND\n    resource.type=gce_instance     name=amet   Required. The client-assigned sink identifier, unique within the project. Example:  my-syslog-errors-to-pubsub . Sink identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: upper and lower-case alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, and periods.    output-version-format=et  Deprecated. The log entry format to use for this sink s exported log entries. The v2 format is used by default and cannot be changed.    start-time=consetetur  Deprecated. This field is ignored when creating or updating sinks.    writer-identity=ut  Output only. An IAM identity mdash;a service account or group mdash;under which Stackdriver Logging writes the exported log entries to the sink s destination. This field is set by sinks.create and sinks.update, based on the setting of unique_writer_identity in those methods.Until you grant this identity write-access to the destination, log entry exports from this sink will fail. For more information, see Granting access for a resource. Consult the destination service s documentation to determine the appropriate IAM roles to assign to the identity.",

The updated sink might also have a new writer_identity; see the unique_writer_identity field.\n\n\nScopes\n\n\nYou will need authorization for at least one of the following scopes to make a valid call:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\n\n\nhttps://www.googleapis.com/auth/logging.admin\n\n\n\n\nIf unset, the scope for this method defaults to \nhttps://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\n.\nYou can set the scope for this method like this: \nlogging2-beta1 --scope \nscope\n projects sinks-update ...\n\n\nRequired Scalar Argument\n\n\n\n\nsink-name\n \n(string)\n\n\nRequired. The full resource name of the sink to update, including the parent resource and the sink identifier:\n    \nprojects/[PROJECT_ID]/sinks/[SINK_ID]\n\n    \norganizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]/sinks/[SINK_ID]\n\n    \nbillingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]/sinks/[SINK_ID]\n\n    \nfolders/[FOLDER_ID]/sinks/[SINK_ID]\n\n    Example: \nprojects/my-project-id/sinks/my-sink-id\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired Request Value\n\n\nThe request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nLogSink:\n  destination: string\n  end-time: string\n  filter: string\n  include-children: boolean\n  name: string\n  output-version-format: string\n  start-time: string\n  writer-identity: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .    destination=ea\n\n\nRequired. The export destination:\n    \nstorage.googleapis.com/[GCS_BUCKET]\n\n    \nbigquery.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/datasets/[DATASET]\n\n    \npubsub.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/topics/[TOPIC_ID]\n\n    The sink\ns writer_identity, set when the sink is created, must have permission to write to the destination or else the log entries are not exported.

An advanced logs filter. The only exported log entries are those that are in the resource owning the sink and that match the filter. For example:\n    logName=\nprojects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]\n AND severity\n=ERROR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninclude-children=true\n\n\n\n\nOptional. This field applies only to sinks owned by organizations and folders. If the field is false, the default, only the logs owned by the sink\ns parent resource are available for export. If the field is true, then logs from all the projects, folders, and billing accounts contained in the sink\ns parent resource are also available for export. Whether a particular log entry from the children is exported depends on the sink\ns filter expression. For example, if this field is true, then the filter resource.type=gce_instance would export all Compute Engine VM instance log entries from all projects in the sink\ns parent. To only export entries from certain child projects, filter on the project part of the log name:\n    logName:(\nprojects/test-project1/\n OR \nprojects/test-project2/\n) AND\n    resource.type=gce_instance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname=dolor\n\n\n\n\nRequired. The client-assigned sink identifier, unique within the project. Example: \nmy-syslog-errors-to-pubsub\n. Sink identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: upper and lower-case alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, and periods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\noutput-version-format=et\n\n\nDeprecated. The log entry format to use for this sink\ns exported log entries. The v2 format is used by default and cannot be changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstart-time=consetetur\n\n\nDeprecated. This field is ignored when creating or updating sinks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwriter-identity=amet.\n\n\nOutput only. An IAM identity\nmdash;a service account or group\nmdash;under which Stackdriver Logging writes the exported log entries to the sink\ns destination. This field is set by sinks.create and sinks.update, based on the setting of unique_writer_identity in those methods.Until you grant this identity write-access to the destination, log entry exports from this sink will fail. For more information, see Granting access for a resource. Consult the destination service\ns documentation to determine the appropriate IAM roles to assign to the identity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that \n-p\n is followed by one \nor more key-value-pairs, and is called like this \n-p k1=v1 k2=v2\n even though the listing below repeats the\n\n-p\n for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p update-mask=string\n\n\n\n\nOptional. Field mask that specifies the fields in sink that need an update. A sink field will be overwritten if, and only if, it is in the update mask. name and output only fields cannot be updated.An empty updateMask is temporarily treated as using the following mask for backwards compatibility purposes:  destination,filter,includeChildren At some point in the future, behavior will be removed and specifying an empty updateMask will be an error.For a detailed FieldMask definition, see https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#fieldmaskExample: updateMask=filter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p unique-writer-identity=boolean\n\n\n\n\nOptional. See sinks.create for a description of this field. When updating a sink, the effect of this field on the value of writer_identity in the updated sink depends on both the old and new values of this field:\n    If the old and new values of this field are both false or both true, then there is no change to the sink\ns writer_identity.\n    If the old value is false and the new value is true, then writer_identity is changed to a unique service account.\n    It is an error if the old value is true and the new value is set to false or defaulted to false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p bearer-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth bearer token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

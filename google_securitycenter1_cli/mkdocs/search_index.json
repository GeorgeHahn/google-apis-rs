You can change the directory used to store configuration with the \n--config-dir\n flag on a per-invocation basis.\n\n\nMore information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMost APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the \nscope\n determines the \nset of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/securitycenter1-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/securitycenter1-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \nsecuritycenter\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \nsecuritycenter1 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

Its format is\n    \norganizations/[organization_id]\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired Request Value\n\n\nThe request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nGroupAssetsRequest:\n  compare-duration: string\n  filter: string\n  group-by: string\n  page-size: integer\n  page-token: string\n  read-time: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .    compare-duration=eirmod\n\n\n\n\nWhen compare_duration is set, the GroupResult\ns \nstate_change\n property is\n    updated to indicate whether the asset was added, removed, or remained\n    present during the compare_duration period of time that precedes the\n    read_time. This is the time between (read_time - compare_duration) and\n    read_time.\n\n\nThe state change value is derived based on the presence of the asset at the\ntwo points in time. Intermediate state changes between the two times don\nt\naffect the result. For example, the results aren\nt affected if the asset is\nremoved and re-created again.\n\n\nPossible \nstate_change\n values when compare_duration is specified:\n\n\n\n\nADDED\n:   indicates that the asset was not present at the start of\n               compare_duration, but present at reference_time.\n\n\nREMOVED\n: indicates that the asset was present at the start of\n               compare_duration, but not present at reference_time.\n\n\nACTIVE\n:  indicates that the asset was present at both the\n               start and the end of the time period defined by\n               compare_duration and reference_time.\n\n\n\n\nIf compare_duration is not specified, then the only possible state_change\nis \nUNUSED\n, which will be the state_change set for all assets present at\nread_time.\n\n\nIf this field is set then \nstate_change\n must be a specified field in\n\ngroup_by\n.\n* \nfilter=sit\n\n    - Expression that defines the filter to apply across assets.\nThe expression is a list of zero or more restrictions combined via logical\noperators \nAND\n and \nOR\n.\nParentheses are supported, and \nOR\n has higher precedence than \nAND\n.\n\n\nRestrictions have the form \nlt;field\ngt; \nlt;operator\ngt; \nlt;value\ngt;\n and may have a \n-\n\ncharacter in front of them to indicate negation. The fields map to those\ndefined in the Asset resource. Examples include:\n\n\n\n\nname\n\n\nsecurity_center_properties.resource_name\n\n\nresource_properties.a_property\n\n\nsecurity_marks.marks.marka\n\n\n\n\nThe supported operators are:\n\n\n\n\n=\n for all value types.\n\n\ngt;\n, \nlt;\n, \ngt;=\n, \nlt;=\n for integer values.\n\n\n:\n, meaning substring matching, for strings.\n\n\n\n\nThe supported value types are:\n\n\n\n\nstring literals in quotes.\n\n\ninteger literals without quotes.\n\n\nboolean literals \ntrue\n and \nfalse\n without quotes.\n\n\n\n\nThe following field and operator combinations are supported:\n\n\n\n\nname: \n=\n\n\nupdate_time: \ngt;\n, \nlt;\n, \ngt;=\n, \nlt;=\n, \n=\n\n\ncreate_time: \ngt;\n, \nlt;\n, \ngt;=\n, \nlt;=\n, \n=\n\n\niam_policy.policy_blob: \n=\n, \n:\n\n\nresource_properties: \n=\n, \n:\n, \ngt;\n, \nlt;\n, \ngt;=\n, \nlt;=\n\n\nsecurity_marks: \n=\n, \n:\n\n\nsecurity_center_properties.resource_name: \n=\n, \n:\n\n\nsecurity_center_properties.resource_type: \n=\n, \n:\n\n\nsecurity_center_properties.resource_parent: \n=\n, \n:\n\n\nsecurity_center_properties.resource_project: \n=\n, \n:\n\n\nsecurity_center_properties.resource_owners: \n=\n, \n:\n\n\n\n\nFor example, \nresource_properties.size = 100\n is a valid filter string.\n* \ngroup-by=stet\n\n    - Expression that defines what assets fields to use for grouping. The string\nvalue should follow SQL syntax: comma separated list of fields. For\nexample:\n\nsecurity_center_properties.resource_project,security_center_properties.project\n.\n\n\nThe following fields are supported when compare_duration is not set:\n\n\n\n\nsecurity_center_properties.resource_project\n\n\nsecurity_center_properties.resource_type\n\n\nsecurity_center_properties.resource_parent\n\n\n\n\nThe following fields are supported when compare_duration is set:\n\n\n\n\nsecurity_center_properties.resource_type\n\n\npage-size=59\n\n\nThe maximum number of results to return in a single response. Default is\n10, minimum is 1, maximum is 1000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npage-token=et\n\n\nThe value returned by the last \nGroupAssetsResponse\n; indicates\nthat this is a continuation of a prior \nGroupAssets\n call, and that the\nsystem should return the next page of data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nread-time=dolores\n\n\nTime used as a reference point when filtering assets. The filter is limited\nto assets existing at the supplied time and their values are those at that\nspecific time. Absence of this field will default to the API\ns version of\nNOW.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

This is the time between (read_time - compare_duration) and\n    read_time.  The state_change value is derived based on the presence and state of the\nfinding at the two points in time.

Possible  state_change  values when compare_duration is specified:   CHANGED :   indicates that the finding was present at the start of\n                 compare_duration, but changed its state at read_time.

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Method Properties\n\n\nYou may set the following properties to further configure the call.

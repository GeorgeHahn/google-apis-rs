You can change the directory used to store configuration with the \n--config-dir\n flag on a per-invocation basis.\n\n\nMore information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMost APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the \nscope\n determines the \nset of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/cloudtasks2-beta2-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/cloudtasks2-beta2-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \ncloudtasks\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \ncloudtasks2-beta2 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

The retry interval\nwill double three times, and then increase linearly by 2^3 * 10s.\nFinally, the task will retry at intervals of\nRetryConfig.max_backoff until the task has been attempted\n\nmax_attempts\n times. Thus, the requests will retry at 10s, 20s,\n40s, 80s, 160s, 240s, 300s, 300s, ....\n\n\n\n\nFor \nApp Engine queues\n,\n  this field is 16 by default.\n\n\nFor \npull queues\n, this field\n  is output only and always 0.\n\n\n\n\nThis field has the same meaning as\n\nmax_doublings in queue.yaml\n.\n\n \nmax-retry-duration=labore\n\n    - If positive, \nmax_retry_duration\n specifies the time limit for retrying a\nfailed task, measured from when the task was first attempted.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p bearer-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth bearer token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

If AppEngineRouting.version is empty, then the task will be sent\nto the version which is the default version when the task is attempted.  If AppEngineRouting.instance is empty, then the task will be sent\nto an instance which is available when the task is attempted.  When AppEngineRouting.service is  default ,\nAppEngineRouting.version is  default , and\nAppEngineRouting.instance is empty, AppEngineRouting.host is\nshortened to just the  application_domain_name .  If AppEngineRouting.service, AppEngineRouting.version, or\nAppEngineRouting.instance is invalid, then the task will be sent\nto the default version of the default service when the task is attempted.\n*  instance=sit \n    - App instance.  By default, the task is sent to an instance which is available when\nthe task is attempted.  Requests can only be sent to a specific instance if manual scaling is used in App Engine Standard .\nApp Engine Flex does not support instances. For more information, see App Engine Standard request routing \nand  App Engine Flex request routing .\n*  service=stet \n    - App service.  By default, the task is sent to the service which is the default\nservice when the task is attempted ( default ).  For some queues or tasks which were created using the App Engine Task Queue\nAPI, AppEngineRouting.host is not parsable into\nAppEngineRouting.service, AppEngineRouting.version, and\nAppEngineRouting.instance. For example, some tasks which were created\nusing the App Engine SDK use a custom domain name; custom domains are not\nparsed by Cloud Tasks. If AppEngineRouting.host is not parsable, then\nAppEngineRouting.service, AppEngineRouting.version, and\nAppEngineRouting.instance are the empty string.\n*  version=sed \n    - App version.  By default, the task is sent to the version which is the default\nversion when the task is attempted ( default ).  For some queues or tasks which were created using the App Engine Task Queue\nAPI, AppEngineRouting.host is not parsable into\nAppEngineRouting.service, AppEngineRouting.version, and\nAppEngineRouting.instance. For example, some tasks which were created\nusing the App Engine SDK use a custom domain name; custom domains are not\nparsed by Cloud Tasks. If AppEngineRouting.host is not parsable, then\nAppEngineRouting.service, AppEngineRouting.version, and\nAppEngineRouting.instance are the empty string.      ...    name=et    The queue name.  The queue name must have the following format: projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID   PROJECT_ID  can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]),\n   hyphens (-), colons (:), or periods (.).\n   For more information, see\n    Identifying projects  LOCATION_ID  is the canonical ID for the queue s location.\n   The list of available locations can be obtained by calling\n   google.cloud.location.Locations.ListLocations.\n   For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/.  QUEUE_ID  can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), or\n  hyphens (-). The maximum length is 100 characters.   Caller-specified and required in CreateQueueRequest, after which\nit becomes output only.\n*  purge-time=dolores \n    - Output only. The last time this queue was purged.  All tasks that were created before this time\nwere purged.  A queue can be purged using CloudTasks.PurgeQueue, the App Engine Task Queue SDK, or the Cloud Console .  Purge time will be truncated to the nearest microsecond. Purge\ntime will be zero if the queue has never been purged.\n*  rate-limits    max-burst-size=38 \n    - Output only. The max burst size.  Max burst size limits how fast the queue is processed when many\ntasks are in the queue and the rate is high. This field allows\nthe queue to have a high rate so processing starts shortly after\na task is enqueued, but still limits resource usage when many\ntasks are enqueued in a short period of time.   For App Engine queues, if\n  RateLimits.max_tasks_dispatched_per_second is 1, this\n  field is 10; otherwise this field is\n  RateLimits.max_tasks_dispatched_per_second / 5.  For pull queues, this field is output only and always 10,000.   Note: For App Engine queues that were created through queue.yaml/xml ,  max_burst_size  might not have the same\nsettings as specified above; CloudTasks.UpdateQueue can be\nused to set  max_burst_size  only to the values specified above.  This field has the same meaning as bucket_size in queue.yaml .\n*  max-concurrent-tasks=79 \n    - The maximum number of concurrent tasks that Cloud Tasks allows\nto be dispatched for this queue. After this threshold has been\nreached, Cloud Tasks stops dispatching tasks until the number of\nconcurrent requests decreases.  The maximum allowed value is 5,000.   For App Engine queues, this field is 10 by default.  For pull queues, this field is output only and always -1, which\n  indicates no limit.   This field has the same meaning as max_concurrent_requests in queue.yaml .\n*  max-tasks-dispatched-per-second=0.921726509896 \n    - The maximum rate at which tasks are dispatched from this\nqueue.  The maximum allowed value is 500.   For App Engine queues, this field is 1 by default.  For pull queues, this field is output only and always 10,000.\n  In addition to the  max_tasks_dispatched_per_second  limit, a maximum of\n  10 QPS of CloudTasks.PullTasks requests are allowed per queue.   This field has the same meaning as rate in queue.yaml .      ..retry-config    max-attempts=31    The maximum number of attempts for a task.  Cloud Tasks will attempt the task  max_attempts  times (that\nis, if the first attempt fails, then there will be max_attempts - 1  retries).  Must be   0.\n*  max-backoff=amet. \n    - The maximum amount of time to wait before retrying a task after\nit fails. The default is 1 hour.   For  App Engine queues ,\n  this field is 1 hour by default.  For  pull queues , this field\n  is output only and always 0.   max_backoff  will be truncated to the nearest second.  This field has the same meaning as max_backoff_seconds in queue.yaml .\n*  max-doublings=20 \n    - The time between retries will double  max_doublings  times.  A task s retry interval starts at RetryConfig.min_backoff,\nthen doubles  max_doublings  times, then increases linearly, and\nfinally retries retries at intervals of\nRetryConfig.max_backoff up to max_attempts times.  For example, if RetryConfig.min_backoff is 10s,\nRetryConfig.max_backoff is 300s, and  max_doublings  is 3,\nthen the a task will first be retried in 10s. The retry interval\nwill double three times, and then increase linearly by 2^3 * 10s.\nFinally, the task will retry at intervals of\nRetryConfig.max_backoff until the task has been attempted max_attempts  times. Thus, the requests will retry at 10s, 20s,\n40s, 80s, 160s, 240s, 300s, 300s, ....   For  App Engine queues ,\n  this field is 16 by default.  For  pull queues , this field\n  is output only and always 0.   This field has the same meaning as max_doublings in queue.yaml .   max-retry-duration=labore \n    - If positive,  max_retry_duration  specifies the time limit for retrying a\nfailed task, measured from when the task was first attempted. Once max_retry_duration  time has passed  and* the task has been attempted\nRetryConfig.max_attempts times, no further attempts will be made and\nthe task will be deleted.  If zero, then the task age is unlimited.   For  App Engine queues ,\n  this field is 0 seconds by default.  For  pull queues , this\n  field is output only and always 0.   max_retry_duration  will be truncated to the nearest second.  This field has the same meaning as task_age_limit in queue.yaml .\n*  min-backoff=sea \n    - The minimum amount of time to wait before retrying a task after\nit fails.   For  App Engine queues ,\n  this field is 0.1 seconds by default.  For  pull queues , this\n  field is output only and always 0.   min_backoff  will be truncated to the nearest second.  This field has the same meaning as min_backoff_seconds in queue.yaml .\n*  unlimited-attempts=false \n    - If true, then the number of attempts is unlimited.      ..    state=dolores    Output only. The state of the queue.  state  can only be changed by called\nCloudTasks.PauseQueue, CloudTasks.ResumeQueue, or uploading queue.yaml .\nCloudTasks.UpdateQueue cannot be used to change  state .",

For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level.

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p bearer-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth bearer token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

If AppEngineRouting.version is empty, then the task will be sent\nto the version which is the default version when the task is attempted.  If AppEngineRouting.instance is empty, then the task will be sent\nto an instance which is available when the task is attempted.  When AppEngineRouting.service is  default ,\nAppEngineRouting.version is  default , and\nAppEngineRouting.instance is empty, AppEngineRouting.host is\nshortened to just the  application_domain_name .  If AppEngineRouting.service, AppEngineRouting.version, or\nAppEngineRouting.instance is invalid, then the task will be sent\nto the default version of the default service when the task is attempted.\n*  instance=amet \n    - App instance.

Requests can only be sent to a specific instance if manual scaling is used in App Engine Standard .\nApp Engine Flex does not support instances. For more information, see App Engine Standard request routing \nand  App Engine Flex request routing .\n*  service=no \n    - App service.  By default, the task is sent to the service which is the default\nservice when the task is attempted ( default ).  For some queues or tasks which were created using the App Engine Task Queue\nAPI, AppEngineRouting.host is not parsable into\nAppEngineRouting.service, AppEngineRouting.version, and\nAppEngineRouting.instance. For example, some tasks which were created\nusing the App Engine SDK use a custom domain name; custom domains are not\nparsed by Cloud Tasks. If AppEngineRouting.host is not parsable, then\nAppEngineRouting.service, AppEngineRouting.version, and\nAppEngineRouting.instance are the empty string.\n*  version=labore \n    - App version.

If the task has an AppEngineHttpRequest.payload, Cloud Tasks sets the\nfollowing headers:   Content-Type : By default, the  Content-Type  header is set to\n   #34;application/octet-stream #34; . The default can be overridden by explictly\n  setting  Content-Type  to a particular media type when the\n   task is created .\n  For example,  Content-Type  can be set to  #34;application/json #34; .  Content-Length : This is computed by Cloud Tasks. This value is\n  output only. It cannot be changed.   The headers below cannot be set or overridden:   Host  X-Google-*  X-AppEngine-*   In addition, some App Engine headers, which contain\ntask-specific information, are also be sent to the task handler; see request headers .\n    - the value will be associated with the given  key \n*  http-method=dolore \n    - The HTTP method to use for the request. The default is POST.  The app s request handler for the task s target URL must be able to handle\nHTTP requests with this http_method, otherwise the task attempt will fail\nwith error code 405 (Method Not Allowed). See Writing a push task request handler \nand the documentation for the request handlers in the language your app is\nwritten in e.g. python RequestHandler .\n*  payload=invidunt \n    - Payload.  The payload will be sent as the HTTP message body. A message\nbody, and thus a payload, is allowed only if the HTTP method is\nPOST or PUT. It is an error to set a data payload on a task with\nan incompatible HttpMethod.\n*  relative-url=aliquyam \n    - The relative URL.  The relative URL must begin with  /  and must be a valid HTTP relative URL.\nIt can contain a path and query string arguments.\nIf the relative URL is empty, then the root path  /  will be used.\nNo spaces are allowed, and the maximum length allowed is 2083 characters.      ..    create-time=accusam    Output only.

Optionally caller-specified in CreateTaskRequest.   pull-message    payload=sea \n    - A data payload consumed by the task worker to execute the task.   tag=et \n    - The task s tag.  Tags allow similar tasks to be processed in a batch. If you label\ntasks with a tag, your task worker can pull tasks\nwith the same tag using PullTasksRequest.filter. For example,\nif you want to aggregate the events associated with a specific\nuser once a day, you could tag tasks with the user ID.  The task s tag can only be set when the\ntask is created.  The tag must be less than 500 bytes.      ..    schedule-time=duo    The time when the task is scheduled to be attempted.  For pull queues, this is the time when the task is available to\nbe leased; if a task is currently leased, this is the time when\nthe current lease expires, that is, the time that the task was\nleased plus the PullTasksRequest.lease_duration.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nPullTasksRequest:\n  filter: string\n  lease-duration: string\n  max-tasks: integer\n  response-view: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order.

A task that has been returned in a\nPullTasksResponse is leased -- that task will not be\nreturned in a different PullTasksResponse before the\nTask.schedule_time.\n\n\nAfter the lease holder has successfully finished the work\nassociated with the task, the lease holder must call\nCloudTasks.AcknowledgeTask. If the task is not acknowledged\nvia CloudTasks.AcknowledgeTask before the\nTask.schedule_time then it will be returned in a later\nPullTasksResponse so that another lease holder can process\nit.\n\n\nThe maximum lease duration is 1 week.\n\nlease_duration\n will be truncated to the nearest second.\n\n \nmax-tasks=49\n\n    - The maximum number of tasks to lease.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly.

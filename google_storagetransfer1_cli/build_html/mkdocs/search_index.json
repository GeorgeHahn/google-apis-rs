No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/storagetransfer1-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \nstoragetransfer\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \nstoragetransfer1 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

Fields in \ntransferJob\n that can be updated are: \ndescription\n, \ntransferSpec\n, and \nstatus\n. To update the \ntransferSpec\n of the job, a complete transfer specification has to be provided. An incomplete specification which misses any required fields will be rejected with the error \nINVALID_ARGUMENT\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly.

Required.    transfer-job    creation-time=sea  This field cannot be changed by user requests.    deletion-time=lorem  This field cannot be changed by user requests.    description=eos  A description provided by the user for the job. Its max length is 1024 bytes when Unicode-encoded.    last-modification-time=erat  This field cannot be changed by user requests.    name=sadipscing  A globally unique name assigned by Storage Transfer Service when the job is created. This field should be left empty in requests to create a new transfer job; otherwise, the requests result in an  INVALID_ARGUMENT  error.    project-id=dolor  The ID of the Google Developers Console project that owns the job. Required.    schedule.schedule-end-date    day=62  Day of month. Must be from 1 to 31 and valid for the year and month, or 0 if specifying a year/month where the day is not sigificant.    month=58  Month of year of date. Must be from 1 to 12.     year=4   Year of date. Must be from 1 to 9,999, or 0 if specifying a date without a year.     ..schedule-start-date    day=41   Day of month. Must be from 1 to 31 and valid for the year and month, or 0 if specifying a year/month where the day is not sigificant.    month=65  Month of year of date.

Should be from 0 to 23. An API may choose to allow the value  24:00:00  for scenarios like business closing time.    minutes=64  Minutes of hour of day. Must be from 0 to 59.    nanos=19  Fractions of seconds in nanoseconds. Must be from 0 to 999,999,999.     seconds=28   Seconds of minutes of the time. Must normally be from 0 to 59. An API may allow the value 60 if it allows leap-seconds.     ...    status=lorem   Status of the job. This value MUST be specified for  CreateTransferJobRequests . NOTE: The effect of the new job status takes place during a subsequent job run. For example, if you change the job status from  ENABLED  to  DISABLED , and an operation spawned by the transfer is running, the status change would not affect the current operation.    transfer-spec.aws-s3-data-source.aws-access-key    access-key-id=sea  AWS access key ID. Required.     secret-access-key=et   AWS secret access key. This field is not returned in RPC responses. Required.     ..    bucket-name=duo   S3 Bucket name (see  Creating a bucket ). Required.     ..gcs-data-sink    bucket-name=et   Google Cloud Storage bucket name (see  Bucket Name Requirements ). Required.     ..gcs-data-source    bucket-name=eirmod   Google Cloud Storage bucket name (see  Bucket Name Requirements ). Required.     ..http-data-source    list-url=sanctus   The URL that points to the file that stores the object list entries. This file must allow public access. Currently, only URLs with HTTP and HTTPS schemes are supported. Required.     ..object-conditions    exclude-prefixes=et   excludePrefixes  must follow the requirements described for  includePrefixes . The max size of  excludePrefixes  is 20.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    include-prefixes=amet  If  includePrefixes  is specified, objects that satisfy the object conditions must have names that start with one of the  includePrefixes  and that do not start with any of the  excludePrefixes . If  includePrefixes  is not specified, all objects except those that have names starting with one of the  excludePrefixes  must satisfy the object conditions. Requirements: * Each include-prefix and exclude-prefix can contain any sequence of Unicode characters, of max length 1024 bytes when UTF8-encoded, and must not contain Carriage Return or Line Feed characters. Wildcard matching and regular expression matching are not supported. * None of the include-prefix or the exclude-prefix values can be empty, if specified. * Each include-prefix must include a distinct portion of the object namespace, i.e., no include-prefix may be a prefix of another include-prefix. * Each exclude-prefix must exclude a distinct portion of the object namespace, i.e., no exclude-prefix may be a prefix of another exclude-prefix. * If  includePrefixes  is specified, then each exclude-prefix must start with the value of a path explicitly included by  includePrefixes . The max size of  includePrefixes  is 20.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    max-time-elapsed-since-last-modification=et  maxTimeElapsedSinceLastModification  is the complement to  minTimeElapsedSinceLastModification .     min-time-elapsed-since-last-modification=consetetur   If unspecified,  minTimeElapsedSinceLastModification  takes a zero value and  maxTimeElapsedSinceLastModification  takes the maximum possible value of Duration. Objects that satisfy the object conditions must either have a  lastModificationTime  greater or equal to  NOW  -  maxTimeElapsedSinceLastModification  and less than  NOW  -  minTimeElapsedSinceLastModification , or not have a  lastModificationTime .     ..transfer-options    delete-objects-from-source-after-transfer=true   Whether objects should be deleted from the source after they are transferred to the sink.    delete-objects-unique-in-sink=true  Whether objects that exist only in the sink should be deleted.     overwrite-objects-already-existing-in-sink=false   Whether overwriting objects that already exist in the sink is allowed.     ....    update-transfer-job-field-mask=dolor   The field mask of the fields in  transferJob  that are to be updated in this request. Fields in  transferJob  that can be updated are:  description ,  transferSpec , and  status . To update the  transferSpec  of the job, a complete transfer specification has to be provided. An incomplete specification which misses any required fields will be rejected with the error  INVALID_ARGUMENT .     About Cursors  The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:   The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the  .  character. Fields can be nested such as in  -r f.s.o  .  The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. . Each additional  .  moves it up one additional level. E.g.  ...  would go three levels up.",

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.  For example, a structure like this:  ResumeTransferOperationRequest:  can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.  About Cursors  The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:   The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the  .  character. Fields can be nested such as in  -r f.s.o  .  The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. . Each additional  .  moves it up one additional level. E.g.  ...  would go three levels up.",

The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/storagetransfer1-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/storagetransfer1-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \nstoragetransfer\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \nstoragetransfer1 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

This field should be left empty in requests to create a new\n    transfer job; otherwise, the requests result in an  INVALID_ARGUMENT \n    error.    project-id=dolor  The ID of the Google Cloud Platform Console project that owns the job.    schedule.schedule-end-date    day=62  Day of month. Must be from 1 to 31 and valid for the year and month, or 0\n    if specifying a year by itself or a year and month where the day is not\n    significant.    month=58  Month of year. Must be from 1 to 12, or 0 if specifying a year without a\n    month and day.     year=4   Year of date. Must be from 1 to 9999, or 0 if specifying a date without\n    a year.     ..schedule-start-date    day=41   Day of month. Must be from 1 to 31 and valid for the year and month, or 0\n    if specifying a year by itself or a year and month where the day is not\n    significant.    month=65  Month of year.

Must be from 1 to 9999, or 0 if specifying a date without\n    a year.     ..start-time-of-day    hours=68   Hours of day in 24 hour format. Should be from 0 to 23. An API may choose\n    to allow the value  24:00:00  for scenarios like business closing time.    minutes=64  Minutes of hour of day. Must be from 0 to 59.    nanos=19  Fractions of seconds in nanoseconds. Must be from 0 to 999,999,999.     seconds=28   Seconds of minutes of the time. Must normally be from 0 to 59. An API may\n    allow the value 60 if it allows leap-seconds.     ...    status=lorem    Status of the job. This value MUST be specified for\n     CreateTransferJobRequests .  NOTE: The effect of the new job status takes place during a subsequent job\nrun. For example, if you change the job status from  ENABLED  to DISABLED , and an operation spawned by the transfer is running, the status\nchange would not affect the current operation.   transfer-spec.aws-s3-data-source.aws-access-key    access-key-id=sea \n    - AWS access key ID.\nRequired.   secret-access-key=et \n    - AWS secret access key. This field is not returned in RPC responses.\nRequired.      ..    bucket-name=duo   S3 Bucket name (see\n     Creating a bucket ).\n    Required.     ..gcs-data-sink    bucket-name=et   Google Cloud Storage bucket name (see\n     Bucket Name\n    Requirements ).\n    Required.     ..gcs-data-source    bucket-name=eirmod   Google Cloud Storage bucket name (see\n     Bucket Name\n    Requirements ).\n    Required.     ..http-data-source    list-url=sanctus   The URL that points to the file that stores the object list entries.\n    This file must allow public access.  Currently, only URLs with HTTP and\n    HTTPS schemes are supported.\n    Required.     ..object-conditions    exclude-prefixes=et    excludePrefixes  must follow the requirements described for\n     includePrefixes .  The max size of  excludePrefixes  is 1000.\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n*  include-prefixes=amet \n    - If  includePrefixes  is specified, objects that satisfy the object\nconditions must have names that start with one of the  includePrefixes \nand that do not start with any of the  excludePrefixes . If  includePrefixes \nis not specified, all objects except those that have names starting with\none of the  excludePrefixes  must satisfy the object conditions.  Requirements:    Each include-prefix and exclude-prefix can contain any sequence of\n    Unicode characters, of max length 1024 bytes when UTF8-encoded, and\n    must not contain Carriage Return or Line Feed characters.  Wildcard\n    matching and regular expression matching are not supported.    Each include-prefix and exclude-prefix must omit the leading slash.\n    For example, to include the  requests.gz  object in a transfer from\n     s3://my-aws-bucket/logs/y=2015/requests.gz , specify the include\n    prefix as  logs/y=2015/requests.gz .    None of the include-prefix or the exclude-prefix values can be empty,\n    if specified.    Each include-prefix must include a distinct portion of the object\n    namespace, i.e., no include-prefix may be a prefix of another\n    include-prefix.    Each exclude-prefix must exclude a distinct portion of the object\n    namespace, i.e., no exclude-prefix may be a prefix of another\n    exclude-prefix.    If  includePrefixes  is specified, then each exclude-prefix must start\n    with the value of a path explicitly included by  includePrefixes .    The max size of  includePrefixes  is 1000.\n    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.   max-time-elapsed-since-last-modification=et \n    -  maxTimeElapsedSinceLastModification  is the complement to minTimeElapsedSinceLastModification .   min-time-elapsed-since-last-modification=consetetur \n    - If unspecified,  minTimeElapsedSinceLastModification  takes a zero value\nand  maxTimeElapsedSinceLastModification  takes the maximum possible\nvalue of Duration. Objects that satisfy the object conditions\nmust either have a  lastModificationTime  greater or equal to NOW  -  maxTimeElapsedSinceLastModification  and less than NOW  -  minTimeElapsedSinceLastModification , or not have a lastModificationTime .      ..transfer-options    delete-objects-from-source-after-transfer=true   Whether objects should be deleted from the source after they are\n    transferred to the sink.  Note that this option and\n     deleteObjectsUniqueInSink  are mutually exclusive.    delete-objects-unique-in-sink=true  Whether objects that exist only in the sink should be deleted.  Note that\n    this option and  deleteObjectsFromSourceAfterTransfer  are mutually\n    exclusive.     overwrite-objects-already-existing-in-sink=false   Whether overwriting objects that already exist in the sink is allowed.     ....    update-transfer-job-field-mask=dolor   The field mask of the fields in  transferJob  that are to be updated in\n    this request.  Fields in  transferJob  that can be updated are:\n     description ,  transferSpec , and  status .  To update the  transferSpec \n    of the job, a complete transfer specification has to be provided.

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify  -r struct.sub_struct=bar .  You can move the cursor one level up by using  .. .

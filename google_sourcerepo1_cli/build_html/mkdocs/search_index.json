APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/sourcerepo1-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \nsourcerepo\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \nsourcerepo1 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

Values are of the form\n    \nprojects/\nlt;project\ngt;\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired Request Value\n\n\nThe request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nRepo:\n  mirror-config:\n    deploy-key-id: string\n    url: string\n    webhook-id: string\n  name: string\n  size: string\n  url: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .mirror-config    deploy-key-id=eirmod\n\n\nID of the SSH deploy key at the other hosting service.\n    Removing this key from the other service would deauthorize\n    Google Cloud Source Repositories from mirroring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nurl=sit\n\n\nURL of the main repository at the other hosting service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwebhook-id=stet\n\n\n\n\nID of the webhook listening to updates to trigger mirroring.\n    Removing this webhook from the other hosting service will stop\n    Google Cloud Source Repositories from receiving notifications,\n    and thereby disabling mirroring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    name=sed\n\n\n\n\nResource name of the repository, of the form\n    \nprojects/\nlt;project\ngt;/repos/\nlt;repo\ngt;\n.  The repo name may contain slashes.\n    eg, \nprojects/myproject/repos/name/with/slash\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsize=et\n\n\nThe disk usage of the repo, in bytes. Read-only field. Size is only\n    returned by GetRepo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nurl=dolores\n\n\nURL to clone the repository from Google Cloud Source Repositories.\n    Read-only field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

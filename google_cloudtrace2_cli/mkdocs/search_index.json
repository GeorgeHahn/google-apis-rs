Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero.\n\n\nIf data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools.\n\n\nEverything else about the \nCloud Trace\n API can be found at the\n\nofficial documentation site\n.\n\n\nInstallation and Source Code\n\n\nInstall the command-line interface with cargo using:\n\n\ncargo install google-cloudtrace2-cli\n\n\n\n\nFind the source code \non github\n.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nThis documentation was generated from the \nCloud Trace\n API at revision \n20171202\n.

You can change the directory used to store configuration with the \n--config-dir\n flag on a per-invocation basis.\n\n\nMore information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMost APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the \nscope\n determines the \nset of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/cloudtrace2-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/cloudtrace2-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \ncloudtrace\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \ncloudtrace2 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p $-xgafv=string\n\n\n\n\nV1 error format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p access-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p bearer-token=string\n\n\n\n\nOAuth bearer token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p callback=string\n\n\n\n\nJSONP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.  For example, a structure like this:  Span:\n  attributes:\n    dropped-attributes-count: integer\n  child-span-count: integer\n  display-name:\n    truncated-byte-count: integer\n    value: string\n  end-time: string\n  links:\n    dropped-links-count: integer\n  name: string\n  parent-span-id: string\n  same-process-as-parent-span: boolean\n  span-id: string\n  stack-trace:\n    stack-frames:\n      dropped-frames-count: integer\n    stack-trace-hash-id: string\n  start-time: string\n  status:\n    code: integer\n    message: string\n  time-events:\n    dropped-annotations-count: integer\n    dropped-message-events-count: integer  can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.    -r .attributes    dropped-attributes-count=62   The number of attributes that were discarded. Attributes can be discarded\n    because their keys are too long or because there are too many attributes.\n    If this value is 0 then all attributes are valid.     ..    child-span-count=53   An optional number of child spans that were generated while this span\n    was active. If set, allows implementation to detect missing child spans.    display-name    truncated-byte-count=36  The number of bytes removed from the original string. If this\n    value is 0, then the string was not shortened.     value=sed    The shortened string. For example, if the original string is 500\n    bytes long and the limit of the string is 128 bytes, then\n     value  contains the first 128 bytes of the 500-byte string.  Truncation always happens on a UTF8 character boundary. If there\nare multi-byte characters in the string, then the length of the\nshortened string might be less than the size limit.      ..    end-time=et   The end time of the span. On the client side, this is the time kept by\n    the local machine where the span execution ends.

[SPAN_ID] is a unique identifier for a span within a trace; it\nis a 16-character hexadecimal encoding of an 8-byte array.   parent-span-id=accusam \n    - The [SPAN_ID] of this span s parent span. If this is a root span,\nthen this field must be empty.   same-process-as-parent-span=true \n    - (Optional) Set this parameter to indicate whether this span is in\nthe same process as its parent. If you do not set this parameter,\nStackdriver Trace is unable to take advantage of this helpful\ninformation.   span-id=justo \n    - The [SPAN_ID] portion of the span s resource name.   stack-trace.stack-frames    dropped-frames-count=100 \n    - The number of stack frames that were dropped because there\nwere too many stack frames.\nIf this value is 0, then no stack frames were dropped.      ..    stack-trace-hash-id=erat    The hash ID is used to conserve network bandwidth for duplicate\n    stack traces within a single trace.  Often multiple spans will have identical stack traces.\nThe first occurrence of a stack trace should contain both the stackFrame  content and a value in  stackTraceHashId .  Subsequent spans within the same request can refer\nto that stack trace by only setting  stackTraceHashId .      ..    start-time=labore   The start time of the span. On the client side, this is the time kept by\n    the local machine where the span execution starts.

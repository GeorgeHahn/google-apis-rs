Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero.\n\n\nIf data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools.\n\n\nInstallation and Source Code\n\n\nInstall the command-line interface with cargo using:\n\n\ncargo install google-surveys2-cli\n\n\n\n\nFind the source code \non github\n.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nThis documentation was generated from the \nSurveys\n API at revision \n20180508\n.

You can change the directory used to store configuration with the \n--config-dir\n flag on a per-invocation basis.\n\n\nMore information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMost APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the \nscope\n determines the \nset of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/surveys2-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/surveys2-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \nsurveys\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \nsurveys2 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

Typically you will have to make a followup call to start the survey giving the final computed cost per response. If the survey has no threshold_answers, setting this property will return an error. By specifying this property, you indicate the max price per response you are willing to pay in advance of the incidence test. If the price turns out to be lower than the specified value, the survey will begin immediately and you will be charged at the rate determined by the incidence pricing test. If the price turns out to be greater than the specified value the survey will not be started and you will instead be notified what price was determined by the incidence test.

Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.     population-source=ipsum   Online population source where the respondents are sampled from.     ..cost    cost-per-response-nanos=lorem   Cost per survey response in nano units of the given currency. To get the total cost for a survey, multiply this value by wanted_response_count.    currency-code=et  Currency code that the cost is given in.    max-cost-per-response-nanos=duo  Deprecated  Threshold to start a survey automatically if the quoted price is at most this value. When a survey has a Screener (threshold) question, it must go through an incidence pricing test to determine the final cost per response. Typically you will have to make a followup call to start the survey giving the final computed cost per response. If the survey has no threshold_answers, setting this property will return an error. By specifying this property, you indicate the max price per response you are willing to pay in advance of the incidence test. If the price turns out to be lower than the specified value, the survey will begin immediately and you will be charged at the rate determined by the incidence pricing test. If the price turns out to be greater than the specified value the survey will not be started and you will instead be notified what price was determined by the incidence test. At that point, you must raise the value of this property to be greater than or equal to that cost before attempting to start the survey again. This will immediately start the survey as long the incidence test was run within the last 21 days. This will no longer be available after June 2018.     nanos=aliquyam   Cost of survey in nano units of the given currency.

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly.

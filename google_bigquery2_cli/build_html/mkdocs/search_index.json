You can change the directory used to store configuration with the \n--config-dir\n flag on a per-invocation basis.\n\n\nMore information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMost APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the \nscope\n determines the \nset of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/bigquery2-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/bigquery2-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \nbigquery\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \nbigquery2 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

Only applicable to CSV, ignored for other formats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nallow-quoted-newlines=true\n\n\nIndicates if BigQuery should allow quoted data sections that contain newline characters in a CSV file. The default value is false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nautodetect=false\n\n\n[Experimental] Indicates if we should automatically infer the options and schema for CSV and JSON sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncreate-disposition=dolor\n\n\n[Optional] Specifies whether the job is allowed to create new tables. The following values are supported: CREATE_IF_NEEDED: If the table does not exist, BigQuery creates the table. CREATE_NEVER: The table must already exist. If it does not, a \nnotFound\n error is returned in the job result. The default value is CREATE_IF_NEEDED. Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndestination-table    dataset-id=dolor\n\n\n[Required] The ID of the dataset containing this table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nproject-id=dolor\n\n\n[Required] The ID of the project containing this table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntable-id=et\n\n\n\n\n[Required] The ID of the table. The ID must contain only letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), or underscores (_). The maximum length is 1,024 characters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    encoding=consetetur\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] The character encoding of the data. The supported values are UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1. The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfield-delimiter=amet.\n\n\n[Optional] The separator for fields in a CSV file. The separator can be any ISO-8859-1 single-byte character. To use a character in the range 128-255, you must encode the character as UTF8. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence \n\\t\n to specify a tab separator. The default value is a comma (\n,\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nignore-unknown-values=true\n\n\n[Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema. If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value: CSV: Trailing columns JSON: Named values that don\nt match any column names\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmax-bad-records=45\n\n\n[Optional] The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery can ignore when running the job. If the number of bad records exceeds this value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnull-marker=gubergren\n\n\n[Optional] This string will be interpreted as a null value when it appears in a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. Please refer to the documentation for further information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprojection-fields=justo\n\n\n[Experimental] If sourceFormat is set to \nDATASTORE_BACKUP\n, indicates which entity properties to load into BigQuery from a Cloud Datastore backup. Property names are case sensitive and must be top-level properties. If no properties are specified, BigQuery loads all properties. If any named property isn\nt found in the Cloud Datastore backup, an invalid error is returned in the job result.\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nquote=sit\n\n\n[Optional] The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote (\n). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nschema-inline=vero\n\n\n[Deprecated] The inline schema. For CSV schemas, specify as \nField1:Type1[,Field2:Type2]*\n. For example, \nfoo:STRING, bar:INTEGER, baz:FLOAT\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nschema-inline-format=diam\n\n\n[Deprecated] The format of the schemaInline property.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nschema-update-options=rebum.\n\n\n[Experimental] Allows the schema of the desitination table to be updated as a side effect of the load job. Schema update options are supported in two cases: when writeDisposition is WRITE_APPEND; when writeDisposition is WRITE_TRUNCATE and the destination table is a partition of a table, specified by partition decorators. For normal tables, WRITE_TRUNCATE will always overwrite the schema. One or more of the following values are specified: ALLOW_FIELD_ADDITION: allow adding a nullable field to the schema. ALLOW_FIELD_RELAXATION: allow relaxing a required field in the original schema to nullable.\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskip-leading-rows=56\n\n\n[Optional] The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when loading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsource-format=sadipscing\n\n\n[Optional] The format of the data files. For CSV files, specify \nCSV\n. For datastore backups, specify \nDATASTORE_BACKUP\n. For newline-delimited JSON, specify \nNEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON\n. For Avro, specify \nAVRO\n. The default value is CSV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsource-uris=vero\n\n\n[Required] The fully-qualified URIs that point to your data in Google Cloud Storage.

The following values are supported: WRITE_TRUNCATE: If the table already exists, BigQuery overwrites the table data. WRITE_APPEND: If the table already exists, BigQuery appends the data to the table. WRITE_EMPTY: If the table already exists and contains data, a \nduplicate\n error is returned in the job result. The default value is WRITE_APPEND. Each action is atomic and only occurs if BigQuery is able to complete the job successfully. Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..query    allow-large-results=false\n\n\n\n\nIf true, allows the query to produce arbitrarily large result tables at a slight cost in performance. Requires destinationTable to be set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncreate-disposition=consetetur\n\n\n[Optional] Specifies whether the job is allowed to create new tables. The following values are supported: CREATE_IF_NEEDED: If the table does not exist, BigQuery creates the table. CREATE_NEVER: The table must already exist.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nRequired Upload Flags\n\n\nThis method supports the upload of data, which \nrequires\n all of the following flags to be set:\n\n\n\n\n-u (simple|resumable)\n\n\nsimple\n - Upload media all at once.\n\n\nresumable\n - Upload media in a resumable fashion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-f file\n\n\nPath to file to upload.

Both keys and values are additionally constrained to be  = 128 bytes in size.  the value will be associated with the given  key    load    allow-jagged-rows=true  [Optional] Accept rows that are missing trailing optional columns. The missing values are treated as nulls. If false, records with missing trailing columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. Only applicable to CSV, ignored for other formats.    allow-quoted-newlines=true  Indicates if BigQuery should allow quoted data sections that contain newline characters in a CSV file. The default value is false.    autodetect=false  [Experimental] Indicates if we should automatically infer the options and schema for CSV and JSON sources.    create-disposition=dolor  [Optional] Specifies whether the job is allowed to create new tables. The following values are supported: CREATE_IF_NEEDED: If the table does not exist, BigQuery creates the table. CREATE_NEVER: The table must already exist.

[Optional] The separator for fields in a CSV file. The separator can be any ISO-8859-1 single-byte character. To use a character in the range 128-255, you must encode the character as UTF8. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence  \\t  to specify a tab separator. The default value is a comma ( , ).    ignore-unknown-values=true  [Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema. If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result.

Property names are case sensitive and must be top-level properties. If no properties are specified, BigQuery loads all properties. If any named property isn t found in the Cloud Datastore backup, an invalid error is returned in the job result.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    quote=sit  [Optional] The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote ( ). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true.    schema-inline=vero  [Deprecated] The inline schema. For CSV schemas, specify as  Field1:Type1[,Field2:Type2]* . For example,  foo:STRING, bar:INTEGER, baz:FLOAT .    schema-inline-format=diam  [Deprecated] The format of the schemaInline property.    schema-update-options=rebum.  [Experimental] Allows the schema of the desitination table to be updated as a side effect of the load job. Schema update options are supported in two cases: when writeDisposition is WRITE_APPEND; when writeDisposition is WRITE_TRUNCATE and the destination table is a partition of a table, specified by partition decorators. For normal tables, WRITE_TRUNCATE will always overwrite the schema. One or more of the following values are specified: ALLOW_FIELD_ADDITION: allow adding a nullable field to the schema. ALLOW_FIELD_RELAXATION: allow relaxing a required field in the original schema to nullable.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    skip-leading-rows=56  [Optional] The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when loading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped.    source-format=sadipscing  [Optional] The format of the data files. For CSV files, specify  CSV . For datastore backups, specify  DATASTORE_BACKUP . For newline-delimited JSON, specify  NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON . For Avro, specify  AVRO . The default value is CSV.    source-uris=vero  [Required] The fully-qualified URIs that point to your data in Google Cloud Storage. Each URI can contain one  *  wildcard character and it must come after the  bucket  name.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.     write-disposition=sadipscing   [Optional] Specifies the action that occurs if the destination table already exists. The following values are supported: WRITE_TRUNCATE: If the table already exists, BigQuery overwrites the table data. WRITE_APPEND: If the table already exists, BigQuery appends the data to the table. WRITE_EMPTY: If the table already exists and contains data, a  duplicate  error is returned in the job result. The default value is WRITE_APPEND. Each action is atomic and only occurs if BigQuery is able to complete the job successfully. Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion.     ..query    allow-large-results=false   If true, allows the query to produce arbitrarily large result tables at a slight cost in performance. Requires destinationTable to be set.    create-disposition=consetetur  [Optional] Specifies whether the job is allowed to create new tables. The following values are supported: CREATE_IF_NEEDED: If the table does not exist, BigQuery creates the table. CREATE_NEVER: The table must already exist.

The maximum length is 1,024 characters.     ..    flatten-results=true   [Optional] Flattens all nested and repeated fields in the query results. The default value is true. allowLargeResults must be true if this is set to false.    maximum-billing-tier=56  [Optional] Limits the billing tier for this job. Queries that have resource usage beyond this tier will fail (without incurring a charge). If unspecified, this will be set to your project default.    maximum-bytes-billed=takimata  [Optional] Limits the bytes billed for this job. Queries that will have bytes billed beyond this limit will fail (without incurring a charge). If unspecified, this will be set to your project default.    parameter-mode=nonumy  [Experimental] Standard SQL only.

The default value is INTERACTIVE.    query=takimata  [Required] BigQuery SQL query to execute.    schema-update-options=at  [Experimental] Allows the schema of the destination table to be updated as a side effect of the query job. Schema update options are supported in two cases: when writeDisposition is WRITE_APPEND; when writeDisposition is WRITE_TRUNCATE and the destination table is a partition of a table, specified by partition decorators. For normal tables, WRITE_TRUNCATE will always overwrite the schema. One or more of the following values are specified: ALLOW_FIELD_ADDITION: allow adding a nullable field to the schema. ALLOW_FIELD_RELAXATION: allow relaxing a required field in the original schema to nullable.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    use-legacy-sql=false  Specifies whether to use BigQuery s legacy SQL dialect for this query. The default value is true. If set to false, the query will use BigQuery s standard SQL: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/sql-reference/ When useLegacySql is set to false, the values of allowLargeResults and flattenResults are ignored; query will be run as if allowLargeResults is true and flattenResults is false.    use-query-cache=true  [Optional] Whether to look for the result in the query cache. The query cache is a best-effort cache that will be flushed whenever tables in the query are modified. Moreover, the query cache is only available when a query does not have a destination table specified. The default value is true.     write-disposition=ea   [Optional] Specifies the action that occurs if the destination table already exists. The following values are supported: WRITE_TRUNCATE: If the table already exists, BigQuery overwrites the table data. WRITE_APPEND: If the table already exists, BigQuery appends the data to the table. WRITE_EMPTY: If the table already exists and contains data, a  duplicate  error is returned in the job result. The default value is WRITE_EMPTY.

Otherwise, they are read with BYTES type values. The default value is false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nread-rowkey-as-string=true\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] If field is true, then the rowkey column families will be read and converted to string.

The default value is false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    compression=lorem\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] The compression type of the data source. Possible values include GZIP and NONE. The default value is NONE.

If true, BigQuery treats missing trailing columns as null values. If false, records with missing trailing columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nallow-quoted-newlines=true\n\n\n[Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow quoted data sections that contain newline characters in a CSV file.

BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfield-delimiter=at\n\n\n[Optional] The separator for fields in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence \n\\t\n to specify a tab separator. The default value is a comma (\n,\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nquote=consetetur\n\n\n[Optional] The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote (\n).

If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskip-leading-rows=et\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when reading the data.

This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..google-sheets-options    skip-leading-rows=sed\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] The number of rows at the top of a sheet that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N \n 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    ignore-unknown-values=true\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema.

Any option specified explicitly will be honored.    bigtable-options    ignore-unspecified-column-families=false  [Optional] If field is true, then the column families that are not specified in columnFamilies list are not exposed in the table schema. Otherwise, they are read with BYTES type values. The default value is false.     read-rowkey-as-string=true   [Optional] If field is true, then the rowkey column families will be read and converted to string. Otherwise they are read with BYTES type values and users need to manually cast them with CAST if necessary.

This setting is ignored for Google Cloud Bigtable, Google Cloud Datastore backups and Avro formats.    csv-options    allow-jagged-rows=false  [Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should accept rows that are missing trailing optional columns. If true, BigQuery treats missing trailing columns as null values. If false, records with missing trailing columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false.    allow-quoted-newlines=true  [Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow quoted data sections that contain newline characters in a CSV file. The default value is false.    encoding=eirmod  [Optional] The character encoding of the data. The supported values are UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1. The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.    field-delimiter=at  [Optional] The separator for fields in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence  \\t  to specify a tab separator. The default value is a comma ( , ).    quote=consetetur  [Optional] The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote ( ). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true.     skip-leading-rows=et   [Optional] The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped.     ..google-sheets-options    skip-leading-rows=sed   [Optional] The number of rows at the top of a sheet that BigQuery will skip when reading the data.

Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.     ..    ignore-unknown-values=true   [Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema. If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value: CSV: Trailing columns JSON: Named values that don t match any column names Google Cloud Bigtable: This setting is ignored.

Any option specified explicitly will be honored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbigtable-options    ignore-unspecified-column-families=false\n\n\n[Optional] If field is true, then the column families that are not specified in columnFamilies list are not exposed in the table schema. Otherwise, they are read with BYTES type values. The default value is false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nread-rowkey-as-string=false\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] If field is true, then the rowkey column families will be read and converted to string. Otherwise they are read with BYTES type values and users need to manually cast them with CAST if necessary. The default value is false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    compression=et\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] The compression type of the data source. Possible values include GZIP and NONE. The default value is NONE.

The default value is a comma (\n,\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nquote=invidunt\n\n\n[Optional] The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote (\n). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string.

The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N \n 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    ignore-unknown-values=false\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema. If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value: CSV: Trailing columns JSON: Named values that don\nt match any column names Google Cloud Bigtable: This setting is ignored. Google Cloud Datastore backups: This setting is ignored. Avro: This setting is ignored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmax-bad-records=7\n\n\n[Optional] The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery can ignore when reading data. If the number of bad records exceeds this value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N \n 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    ignore-unknown-values=true\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema. If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value: CSV: Trailing columns JSON: Named values that don\nt match any column names Google Cloud Bigtable: This setting is ignored.

Otherwise they are read with BYTES type values and users need to manually cast them with CAST if necessary. The default value is false.     ..    compression=lorem   [Optional] The compression type of the data source. Possible values include GZIP and NONE. The default value is NONE. This setting is ignored for Google Cloud Bigtable, Google Cloud Datastore backups and Avro formats.    csv-options    allow-jagged-rows=true  [Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should accept rows that are missing trailing optional columns. If true, BigQuery treats missing trailing columns as null values. If false, records with missing trailing columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false.    allow-quoted-newlines=false  [Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow quoted data sections that contain newline characters in a CSV file. The default value is false.    encoding=clita  [Optional] The character encoding of the data. The supported values are UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1. The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.    field-delimiter=eos  [Optional] The separator for fields in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence  \\t  to specify a tab separator. The default value is a comma ( , ).    quote=dolores  [Optional] The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote ( ). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true.     skip-leading-rows=vero   [Optional] The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped.     ..google-sheets-options    skip-leading-rows=consetetur   [Optional] The number of rows at the top of a sheet that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N   0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.     ..    ignore-unknown-values=true   [Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema. If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value: CSV: Trailing columns JSON: Named values that don t match any column names Google Cloud Bigtable: This setting is ignored. Google Cloud Datastore backups: This setting is ignored. Avro: This setting is ignored.    max-bad-records=5  [Optional] The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery can ignore when reading data. If the number of bad records exceeds this value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid. This setting is ignored for Google Cloud Bigtable, Google Cloud Datastore backups and Avro formats.    source-format=eos  [Required] The data format. For CSV files, specify  CSV . For Google sheets, specify  GOOGLE_SHEETS . For newline-delimited JSON, specify  NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON . For Avro files, specify  AVRO . For Google Cloud Datastore backups, specify  DATASTORE_BACKUP . [Experimental] For Google Cloud Bigtable, specify  BIGTABLE . Please note that reading from Google Cloud Bigtable is experimental and has to be enabled for your project. Please contact Google Cloud Support to enable this for your project.     source-uris=justo   [Required] The fully-qualified URIs that point to your data in Google Cloud. For Google Cloud Storage URIs: Each URI can contain one   wildcard character and it must come after the  bucket  name. Size limits related to load jobs apply to external data sources. For Google Cloud Bigtable URIs: Exactly one URI can be specified and it has be a fully specified and valid HTTPS URL for a Google Cloud Bigtable table. For Google Cloud Datastore backups, exactly one URI can be specified, and it must end with  .backup_info . Also, the   wildcard character is not allowed.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.     ..    friendly-name=tempor   [Optional] A descriptive name for this table.    id=gubergren  [Output-only] An opaque ID uniquely identifying the table.    kind=dolore  [Output-only] The type of the resource.    labels=key=amet.  [Experimental] The labels associated with this table. You can use these to organize and group your tables. Label keys and values can be no longer than 63 characters, can only contain letters, numeric characters, underscores and dashes. International characters are allowed. Label values are optional. Label keys must start with a letter and must be unique within a dataset. Both keys and values are additionally constrained to be  = 128 bytes in size.  the value will be associated with the given  key    last-modified-time=dolore  [Output-only] The time when this table was last modified, in milliseconds since the epoch.    location=magna  [Output-only] The geographic location where the table resides. This value is inherited from the dataset.    num-bytes=elitr  [Output-only] The size of this table in bytes, excluding any data in the streaming buffer.    num-long-term-bytes=magna  [Output-only] The number of bytes in the table that are considered  long-term storage .    num-rows=ipsum  [Output-only] The number of rows of data in this table, excluding any data in the streaming buffer.    self-link=invidunt  [Output-only] A URL that can be used to access this resource again.    streaming-buffer    estimated-bytes=accusam  [Output-only] A lower-bound estimate of the number of bytes currently in the streaming buffer.    estimated-rows=labore  [Output-only] A lower-bound estimate of the number of rows currently in the streaming buffer.     oldest-entry-time=diam   [Output-only] Contains the timestamp of the oldest entry in the streaming buffer, in milliseconds since the epoch, if the streaming buffer is available.     ..table-reference    dataset-id=nonumy   [Required] The ID of the dataset containing this table.    project-id=sed  [Required] The ID of the project containing this table.     table-id=diam   [Required] The ID of the table. The ID must contain only letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), or underscores (_).

The following values are supported: TABLE: A normal BigQuery table. VIEW: A virtual table defined by a SQL query. EXTERNAL: A table that references data stored in an external storage system, such as Google Cloud Storage. The default value is TABLE.    view    query=dolor  [Required] A query that BigQuery executes when the view is referenced.    use-legacy-sql=true  Specifies whether to use BigQuery s legacy SQL for this view. The default value is true. If set to false, the view will use BigQuery s standard SQL: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/sql-reference/ Queries and views that reference this view must use the same flag value.",

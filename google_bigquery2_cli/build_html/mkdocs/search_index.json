You can change the directory used to store configuration with the \n--config-dir\n flag on a per-invocation basis.\n\n\nMore information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMost APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the \nscope\n determines the \nset of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/bigquery2-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/bigquery2-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \nbigquery\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \nbigquery2 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

The following values are supported: WRITE_TRUNCATE: If the table already exists, BigQuery overwrites the table data. WRITE_APPEND: If the table already exists, BigQuery appends the data to the table. WRITE_EMPTY: If the table already exists and contains data, a \nduplicate\n error is returned in the job result. The default value is WRITE_EMPTY. Each action is atomic and only occurs if BigQuery is able to complete the job successfully. Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    dry-run=true\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] If set, don\nt actually run this job. A valid query will return a mostly empty response with some processing statistics, while an invalid query will return the same error it would if it wasn\nt a dry run.

The missing values are treated as nulls. If false, records with missing trailing columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. Only applicable to CSV, ignored for other formats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nallow-quoted-newlines=false\n\n\nIndicates if BigQuery should allow quoted data sections that contain newline characters in a CSV file. The default value is false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nautodetect=false\n\n\n[Optional] Indicates if we should automatically infer the options and schema for CSV and JSON sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclustering    fields=voluptua.\n\n\n\n\n[Repeated] One or more fields on which data should be clustered. Only top-level, non-repeated, simple-type fields are supported. When you cluster a table using multiple columns, the order of columns you specify is important. The order of the specified columns determines the sort order of the data.\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    create-disposition=lorem\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] Specifies whether the job is allowed to create new tables. The following values are supported: CREATE_IF_NEEDED: If the table does not exist, BigQuery creates the table. CREATE_NEVER: The table must already exist. If it does not, a \nnotFound\n error is returned in the job result. The default value is CREATE_IF_NEEDED.

This will only be used if the destination table is newly created. If the table already exists and a value different than the current description is provided, the job will fail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfriendly-name=rebum.\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] The friendly name for the destination table. This will only be used if the destination table is newly created. If the table already exists and a value different than the current friendly name is provided, the job will fail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    encoding=consetetur\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] The character encoding of the data. The supported values are UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1. The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfield-delimiter=sadipscing\n\n\n[Optional] The separator for fields in a CSV file. The separator can be any ISO-8859-1 single-byte character. To use a character in the range 128-255, you must encode the character as UTF8. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence \n\\t\n to specify a tab separator. The default value is a comma (\n,\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nignore-unknown-values=false\n\n\n[Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema. If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value: CSV: Trailing columns JSON: Named values that don\nt match any column names\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmax-bad-records=6\n\n\n[Optional] The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery can ignore when running the job. If the number of bad records exceeds this value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. This is only valid for CSV and JSON. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnull-marker=invidunt\n\n\n[Optional] Specifies a string that represents a null value in a CSV file. For example, if you specify \n\\N\n, BigQuery interprets \n\\N\n as a null value when loading a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as an empty value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprojection-fields=consetetur\n\n\nIf sourceFormat is set to \nDATASTORE_BACKUP\n, indicates which entity properties to load into BigQuery from a Cloud Datastore backup. Property names are case sensitive and must be top-level properties. If no properties are specified, BigQuery loads all properties. If any named property isn\nt found in the Cloud Datastore backup, an invalid error is returned in the job result.\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nquote=dolore\n\n\n[Optional] The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote (\n). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nschema-inline=duo\n\n\n[Deprecated] The inline schema. For CSV schemas, specify as \nField1:Type1[,Field2:Type2]*\n. For example, \nfoo:STRING, bar:INTEGER, baz:FLOAT\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nschema-inline-format=aliquyam\n\n\n[Deprecated] The format of the schemaInline property.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nschema-update-options=lorem\n\n\nAllows the schema of the destination table to be updated as a side effect of the load job if a schema is autodetected or supplied in the job configuration. Schema update options are supported in two cases: when writeDisposition is WRITE_APPEND; when writeDisposition is WRITE_TRUNCATE and the destination table is a partition of a table, specified by partition decorators. For normal tables, WRITE_TRUNCATE will always overwrite the schema. One or more of the following values are specified: ALLOW_FIELD_ADDITION: allow adding a nullable field to the schema. ALLOW_FIELD_RELAXATION: allow relaxing a required field in the original schema to nullable.\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskip-leading-rows=84\n\n\n[Optional] The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when loading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsource-format=clita\n\n\n[Optional] The format of the data files. For CSV files, specify \nCSV\n. For datastore backups, specify \nDATASTORE_BACKUP\n. For newline-delimited JSON, specify \nNEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON\n. For Avro, specify \nAVRO\n. For parquet, specify \nPARQUET\n. For orc, specify \nORC\n. The default value is CSV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsource-uris=consetetur\n\n\n[Required] The fully-qualified URIs that point to your data in Google Cloud. For Google Cloud Storage URIs: Each URI can contain one \n wildcard character and it must come after the \nbucket\n name. Size limits related to load jobs apply to external data sources. For Google Cloud Bigtable URIs: Exactly one URI can be specified and it has be a fully specified and valid HTTPS URL for a Google Cloud Bigtable table. For Google Cloud Datastore backups: Exactly one URI can be specified. Also, the \n wildcard character is not allowed.\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntime-partitioning    expiration-ms=takimata\n\n\n[Optional] Number of milliseconds for which to keep the storage for partitions in the table. The storage in a partition will have an expiration time of its partition time plus this value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfield=nonumy\n\n\n[Beta] [Optional] If not set, the table is partitioned by pseudo column, referenced via either \n_PARTITIONTIME\n as TIMESTAMP type, or \n_PARTITIONDATE\n as DATE type. If field is specified, the table is instead partitioned by this field. The field must be a top-level TIMESTAMP or DATE field. Its mode must be NULLABLE or REQUIRED.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequire-partition-filter=true\n\n\n[Beta] [Optional] If set to true, queries over this table require a partition filter that can be used for partition elimination to be specified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntype=sanctus\n\n\n\n\n[Required] The only type supported is DAY, which will generate one partition per day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    use-avro-logical-types=false\n\n\n\n\nIf sourceFormat is set to \nAVRO\n, indicates whether to enable interpreting logical types into their corresponding types (ie. TIMESTAMP), instead of only using their raw types (ie. INTEGER). The default value will be true once this feature launches, but can be set now in preparation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwrite-disposition=at\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] Specifies the action that occurs if the destination table already exists. The following values are supported: WRITE_TRUNCATE: If the table already exists, BigQuery overwrites the table data. WRITE_APPEND: If the table already exists, BigQuery appends the data to the table. WRITE_EMPTY: If the table already exists and contains data, a \nduplicate\n error is returned in the job result. The default value is WRITE_APPEND. Each action is atomic and only occurs if BigQuery is able to complete the job successfully. Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..query    allow-large-results=false\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] If true and query uses legacy SQL dialect, allows the query to produce arbitrarily large result tables at a slight cost in performance. Requires destinationTable to be set. For standard SQL queries, this flag is ignored and large results are always allowed. However, you must still set destinationTable when result size exceeds the allowed maximum response size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclustering    fields=invidunt\n\n\n\n\n[Repeated] One or more fields on which data should be clustered. Only top-level, non-repeated, simple-type fields are supported. When you cluster a table using multiple columns, the order of columns you specify is important. The order of the specified columns determines the sort order of the data.\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    create-disposition=ea\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] Specifies whether the job is allowed to create new tables. The following values are supported: CREATE_IF_NEEDED: If the table does not exist, BigQuery creates the table. CREATE_NEVER: The table must already exist. If it does not, a \nnotFound\n error is returned in the job result. The default value is CREATE_IF_NEEDED. Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndefault-dataset    dataset-id=sadipscing\n\n\n[Required] A unique ID for this dataset, without the project name. The ID must contain only letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), or underscores (_).

For standard SQL queries, this flag is ignored and results are never flattened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaximum-billing-tier=61\n\n\n[Optional] Limits the billing tier for this job. Queries that have resource usage beyond this tier will fail (without incurring a charge). If unspecified, this will be set to your project default.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaximum-bytes-billed=consetetur\n\n\n[Optional] Limits the bytes billed for this job. Queries that will have bytes billed beyond this limit will fail (without incurring a charge). If unspecified, this will be set to your project default.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nparameter-mode=labore\n\n\nStandard SQL only. Set to POSITIONAL to use positional (?) query parameters or to NAMED to use named (@myparam) query parameters in this query.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npreserve-nulls=true\n\n\n[Deprecated] This property is deprecated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npriority=ea\n\n\n[Optional] Specifies a priority for the query.

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nRequired Upload Flags\n\n\nThis method supports the upload of data, which \nrequires\n all of the following flags to be set:\n\n\n\n\n-u (simple|resumable)\n\n\nsimple\n - Upload media all at once.\n\n\nresumable\n - Upload media in a resumable fashion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-f file\n\n\nPath to file to upload.

The BigQuery Service Account associated with your project requires access to this encryption key.     ..destination-table    dataset-id=justo   [Required] The ID of the dataset containing this table.    project-id=sit  [Required] The ID of the project containing this table.     table-id=vero   [Required] The ID of the table. The ID must contain only letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), or underscores (_). The maximum length is 1,024 characters.     ..destination-table-properties    description=diam   [Optional] The description for the destination table. This will only be used if the destination table is newly created. If the table already exists and a value different than the current description is provided, the job will fail.     friendly-name=rebum.   [Optional] The friendly name for the destination table. This will only be used if the destination table is newly created. If the table already exists and a value different than the current friendly name is provided, the job will fail.     ..    encoding=consetetur   [Optional] The character encoding of the data. The supported values are UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1. The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.    field-delimiter=sadipscing  [Optional] The separator for fields in a CSV file. The separator can be any ISO-8859-1 single-byte character. To use a character in the range 128-255, you must encode the character as UTF8. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence  \\t  to specify a tab separator. The default value is a comma ( , ).    ignore-unknown-values=false  [Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema. If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value: CSV: Trailing columns JSON: Named values that don t match any column names    max-bad-records=6  [Optional] The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery can ignore when running the job. If the number of bad records exceeds this value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. This is only valid for CSV and JSON. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid.    null-marker=invidunt  [Optional] Specifies a string that represents a null value in a CSV file. For example, if you specify  \\N , BigQuery interprets  \\N  as a null value when loading a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as an empty value.    projection-fields=consetetur  If sourceFormat is set to  DATASTORE_BACKUP , indicates which entity properties to load into BigQuery from a Cloud Datastore backup. Property names are case sensitive and must be top-level properties. If no properties are specified, BigQuery loads all properties. If any named property isn t found in the Cloud Datastore backup, an invalid error is returned in the job result.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    quote=dolore  [Optional] The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote ( ). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true.    schema-inline=duo  [Deprecated] The inline schema. For CSV schemas, specify as  Field1:Type1[,Field2:Type2]* . For example,  foo:STRING, bar:INTEGER, baz:FLOAT .    schema-inline-format=aliquyam  [Deprecated] The format of the schemaInline property.    schema-update-options=lorem  Allows the schema of the destination table to be updated as a side effect of the load job if a schema is autodetected or supplied in the job configuration. Schema update options are supported in two cases: when writeDisposition is WRITE_APPEND; when writeDisposition is WRITE_TRUNCATE and the destination table is a partition of a table, specified by partition decorators. For normal tables, WRITE_TRUNCATE will always overwrite the schema. One or more of the following values are specified: ALLOW_FIELD_ADDITION: allow adding a nullable field to the schema. ALLOW_FIELD_RELAXATION: allow relaxing a required field in the original schema to nullable.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    skip-leading-rows=84  [Optional] The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when loading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped.    source-format=clita  [Optional] The format of the data files. For CSV files, specify  CSV . For datastore backups, specify  DATASTORE_BACKUP . For newline-delimited JSON, specify  NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON . For Avro, specify  AVRO .

For Google Cloud Bigtable URIs: Exactly one URI can be specified and it has be a fully specified and valid HTTPS URL for a Google Cloud Bigtable table. For Google Cloud Datastore backups: Exactly one URI can be specified. Also, the   wildcard character is not allowed.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    time-partitioning    expiration-ms=takimata  [Optional] Number of milliseconds for which to keep the storage for partitions in the table. The storage in a partition will have an expiration time of its partition time plus this value.    field=nonumy  [Beta] [Optional] If not set, the table is partitioned by pseudo column, referenced via either  _PARTITIONTIME  as TIMESTAMP type, or  _PARTITIONDATE  as DATE type. If field is specified, the table is instead partitioned by this field. The field must be a top-level TIMESTAMP or DATE field. Its mode must be NULLABLE or REQUIRED.    require-partition-filter=true  [Beta] [Optional] If set to true, queries over this table require a partition filter that can be used for partition elimination to be specified.     type=sanctus   [Required] The only type supported is DAY, which will generate one partition per day.     ..    use-avro-logical-types=false   If sourceFormat is set to  AVRO , indicates whether to enable interpreting logical types into their corresponding types (ie. TIMESTAMP), instead of only using their raw types (ie. INTEGER). The default value will be true once this feature launches, but can be set now in preparation.     write-disposition=at   [Optional] Specifies the action that occurs if the destination table already exists. The following values are supported: WRITE_TRUNCATE: If the table already exists, BigQuery overwrites the table data. WRITE_APPEND: If the table already exists, BigQuery appends the data to the table. WRITE_EMPTY: If the table already exists and contains data, a  duplicate  error is returned in the job result. The default value is WRITE_APPEND. Each action is atomic and only occurs if BigQuery is able to complete the job successfully. Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion.     ..query    allow-large-results=false   [Optional] If true and query uses legacy SQL dialect, allows the query to produce arbitrarily large result tables at a slight cost in performance. Requires destinationTable to be set. For standard SQL queries, this flag is ignored and large results are always allowed. However, you must still set destinationTable when result size exceeds the allowed maximum response size.     clustering    fields=invidunt   [Repeated] One or more fields on which data should be clustered. Only top-level, non-repeated, simple-type fields are supported. When you cluster a table using multiple columns, the order of columns you specify is important. The order of the specified columns determines the sort order of the data.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.     ..    create-disposition=ea   [Optional] Specifies whether the job is allowed to create new tables. The following values are supported: CREATE_IF_NEEDED: If the table does not exist, BigQuery creates the table. CREATE_NEVER: The table must already exist. If it does not, a  notFound  error is returned in the job result. The default value is CREATE_IF_NEEDED. Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion.    default-dataset    dataset-id=sadipscing  [Required] A unique ID for this dataset, without the project name. The ID must contain only letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), or underscores (_). The maximum length is 1,024 characters.     project-id=rebum.   [Optional] The ID of the project containing this dataset.     ..destination-encryption-configuration    kms-key-name=dolore   [Optional] Describes the Cloud KMS encryption key that will be used to protect destination BigQuery table.

The maximum length is 1,024 characters.     ..    flatten-results=false   [Optional] If true and query uses legacy SQL dialect, flattens all nested and repeated fields in the query results. allowLargeResults must be true if this is set to false. For standard SQL queries, this flag is ignored and results are never flattened.    maximum-billing-tier=61  [Optional] Limits the billing tier for this job. Queries that have resource usage beyond this tier will fail (without incurring a charge). If unspecified, this will be set to your project default.    maximum-bytes-billed=consetetur  [Optional] Limits the bytes billed for this job. Queries that will have bytes billed beyond this limit will fail (without incurring a charge). If unspecified, this will be set to your project default.    parameter-mode=labore  Standard SQL only. Set to POSITIONAL to use positional (?) query parameters or to NAMED to use named (@myparam) query parameters in this query.    preserve-nulls=true  [Deprecated] This property is deprecated.    priority=ea  [Optional] Specifies a priority for the query. Possible values include INTERACTIVE and BATCH. The default value is INTERACTIVE.    query=gubergren  [Required] SQL query text to execute. The useLegacySql field can be used to indicate whether the query uses legacy SQL or standard SQL.    schema-update-options=aliquyam  Allows the schema of the destination table to be updated as a side effect of the query job. Schema update options are supported in two cases: when writeDisposition is WRITE_APPEND; when writeDisposition is WRITE_TRUNCATE and the destination table is a partition of a table, specified by partition decorators. For normal tables, WRITE_TRUNCATE will always overwrite the schema. One or more of the following values are specified: ALLOW_FIELD_ADDITION: allow adding a nullable field to the schema. ALLOW_FIELD_RELAXATION: allow relaxing a required field in the original schema to nullable.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    time-partitioning    expiration-ms=eos  [Optional] Number of milliseconds for which to keep the storage for partitions in the table. The storage in a partition will have an expiration time of its partition time plus this value.    field=tempor  [Beta] [Optional] If not set, the table is partitioned by pseudo column, referenced via either  _PARTITIONTIME  as TIMESTAMP type, or  _PARTITIONDATE  as DATE type. If field is specified, the table is instead partitioned by this field. The field must be a top-level TIMESTAMP or DATE field. Its mode must be NULLABLE or REQUIRED.    require-partition-filter=false  [Beta] [Optional] If set to true, queries over this table require a partition filter that can be used for partition elimination to be specified.     type=labore   [Required] The only type supported is DAY, which will generate one partition per day.     ..    use-legacy-sql=false   Specifies whether to use BigQuery s legacy SQL dialect for this query. The default value is true. If set to false, the query will use BigQuery s standard SQL: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/sql-reference/ When useLegacySql is set to false, the value of flattenResults is ignored; query will be run as if flattenResults is false.    use-query-cache=true  [Optional] Whether to look for the result in the query cache. The query cache is a best-effort cache that will be flushed whenever tables in the query are modified. Moreover, the query cache is only available when a query does not have a destination table specified. The default value is true.     write-disposition=dolores   [Optional] Specifies the action that occurs if the destination table already exists. The following values are supported: WRITE_TRUNCATE: If the table already exists, BigQuery overwrites the table data and uses the schema from the query result. WRITE_APPEND: If the table already exists, BigQuery appends the data to the table. WRITE_EMPTY: If the table already exists and contains data, a  duplicate  error is returned in the job result. The default value is WRITE_EMPTY. Each action is atomic and only occurs if BigQuery is able to complete the job successfully.

You can call GetQueryResults() to wait for the query to complete and read the results. The default value is 10000 milliseconds (10 seconds).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuse-legacy-sql=true\n\n\nSpecifies whether to use BigQuery\ns legacy SQL dialect for this query. The default value is true.

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level.

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-r .clustering    fields=vero\n\n\n\n\n[Repeated] One or more fields on which data should be clustered. Only top-level, non-repeated, simple-type fields are supported. When you cluster a table using multiple columns, the order of columns you specify is important. The order of the specified columns determines the sort order of the data.\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    creation-time=ut\n\n\n\n\n[Output-only] The time when this table was created, in milliseconds since the epoch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndescription=sed\n\n\n[Optional] A user-friendly description of this table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nencryption-configuration    kms-key-name=et\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] Describes the Cloud KMS encryption key that will be used to protect destination BigQuery table. The BigQuery Service Account associated with your project requires access to this encryption key.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    etag=ipsum\n\n\n\n\n[Output-only] A hash of the table metadata.

Otherwise, they are read with BYTES type values. The default value is false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nread-rowkey-as-string=false\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] If field is true, then the rowkey column families will be read and converted to string. Otherwise they are read with BYTES type values and users need to manually cast them with CAST if necessary. The default value is false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    compression=takimata\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] The compression type of the data source. Possible values include GZIP and NONE. The default value is NONE. This setting is ignored for Google Cloud Bigtable, Google Cloud Datastore backups and Avro formats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncsv-options    allow-jagged-rows=true\n\n\n[Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should accept rows that are missing trailing optional columns. If true, BigQuery treats missing trailing columns as null values. If false, records with missing trailing columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nallow-quoted-newlines=false\n\n\n[Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow quoted data sections that contain newline characters in a CSV file. The default value is false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nencoding=et\n\n\n[Optional] The character encoding of the data. The supported values are UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1. The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfield-delimiter=sed\n\n\n[Optional] The separator for fields in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence \n\\t\n to specify a tab separator. The default value is a comma (\n,\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nquote=no\n\n\n[Optional] The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote (\n). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskip-leading-rows=invidunt\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when reading the data.

This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..google-sheets-options    range=rebum.\n\n\n\n\n[Beta] [Optional] Range of a sheet to query from. Only used when non-empty. Typical format: !:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskip-leading-rows=labore\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] The number of rows at the top of a sheet that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N \n 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    ignore-unknown-values=false\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema. If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value: CSV: Trailing columns JSON: Named values that don\nt match any column names Google Cloud Bigtable: This setting is ignored. Google Cloud Datastore backups: This setting is ignored. Avro: This setting is ignored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmax-bad-records=7\n\n\n[Optional] The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery can ignore when reading data. If the number of bad records exceeds this value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. This is only valid for CSV, JSON, and Google Sheets. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid. This setting is ignored for Google Cloud Bigtable, Google Cloud Datastore backups and Avro formats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsource-format=consetetur\n\n\n[Required] The data format. For CSV files, specify \nCSV\n. For Google sheets, specify \nGOOGLE_SHEETS\n. For newline-delimited JSON, specify \nNEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON\n. For Avro files, specify \nAVRO\n.

If set to false, the view will use BigQuery\ns standard SQL: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/sql-reference/ Queries and views that reference this view must use the same flag value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

If true, BigQuery treats missing trailing columns as null values. If false, records with missing trailing columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false.    allow-quoted-newlines=false  [Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow quoted data sections that contain newline characters in a CSV file. The default value is false.    encoding=et  [Optional] The character encoding of the data. The supported values are UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1. The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.    field-delimiter=sed  [Optional] The separator for fields in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence  \\t  to specify a tab separator. The default value is a comma ( , ).    quote=no  [Optional] The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote ( ). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true.     skip-leading-rows=invidunt   [Optional] The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped.     ..google-sheets-options    range=rebum.   [Beta] [Optional] Range of a sheet to query from. Only used when non-empty. Typical format: !:     skip-leading-rows=labore   [Optional] The number of rows at the top of a sheet that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N   0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.     ..    ignore-unknown-values=false   [Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema. If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value: CSV: Trailing columns JSON: Named values that don t match any column names Google Cloud Bigtable: This setting is ignored. Google Cloud Datastore backups: This setting is ignored. Avro: This setting is ignored.    max-bad-records=7  [Optional] The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery can ignore when reading data. If the number of bad records exceeds this value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. This is only valid for CSV, JSON, and Google Sheets. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid. This setting is ignored for Google Cloud Bigtable, Google Cloud Datastore backups and Avro formats.    source-format=consetetur  [Required] The data format. For CSV files, specify  CSV .

The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N \n 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    ignore-unknown-values=true\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema. If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value: CSV: Trailing columns JSON: Named values that don\nt match any column names Google Cloud Bigtable: This setting is ignored. Google Cloud Datastore backups: This setting is ignored. Avro: This setting is ignored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmax-bad-records=18\n\n\n[Optional] The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery can ignore when reading data.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.    -r .clustering    fields=accusam   [Repeated] One or more fields on which data should be clustered. Only top-level, non-repeated, simple-type fields are supported. When you cluster a table using multiple columns, the order of columns you specify is important. The order of the specified columns determines the sort order of the data.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.     ..    creation-time=magna   [Output-only] The time when this table was created, in milliseconds since the epoch.    description=lorem  [Optional] A user-friendly description of this table.     encryption-configuration    kms-key-name=rebum.   [Optional] Describes the Cloud KMS encryption key that will be used to protect destination BigQuery table. The BigQuery Service Account associated with your project requires access to this encryption key.     ..    etag=et   [Output-only] A hash of the table metadata. Used to ensure there were no concurrent modifications to the resource when attempting an update. Not guaranteed to change when the table contents or the fields numRows, numBytes, numLongTermBytes or lastModifiedTime change.    expiration-time=clita  [Optional] The time when this table expires, in milliseconds since the epoch. If not present, the table will persist indefinitely. Expired tables will be deleted and their storage reclaimed. The defaultTableExpirationMs property of the encapsulating dataset can be used to set a default expirationTime on newly created tables.    external-data-configuration    autodetect=true  Try to detect schema and format options automatically. Any option specified explicitly will be honored.    bigtable-options    ignore-unspecified-column-families=false  [Optional] If field is true, then the column families that are not specified in columnFamilies list are not exposed in the table schema. Otherwise, they are read with BYTES type values. The default value is false.     read-rowkey-as-string=true   [Optional] If field is true, then the rowkey column families will be read and converted to string. Otherwise they are read with BYTES type values and users need to manually cast them with CAST if necessary. The default value is false.     ..    compression=consetetur   [Optional] The compression type of the data source. Possible values include GZIP and NONE. The default value is NONE. This setting is ignored for Google Cloud Bigtable, Google Cloud Datastore backups and Avro formats.    csv-options    allow-jagged-rows=true  [Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should accept rows that are missing trailing optional columns. If true, BigQuery treats missing trailing columns as null values. If false, records with missing trailing columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false.    allow-quoted-newlines=false  [Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow quoted data sections that contain newline characters in a CSV file. The default value is false.    encoding=eos  [Optional] The character encoding of the data. The supported values are UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1. The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.    field-delimiter=justo  [Optional] The separator for fields in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence  \\t  to specify a tab separator. The default value is a comma ( , ).    quote=tempor  [Optional] The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote ( ). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true.     skip-leading-rows=gubergren   [Optional] The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped.     ..google-sheets-options    range=dolore   [Beta] [Optional] Range of a sheet to query from. Only used when non-empty. Typical format: !:     skip-leading-rows=amet.   [Optional] The number of rows at the top of a sheet that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N   0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.     ..    ignore-unknown-values=true   [Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema. If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value: CSV: Trailing columns JSON: Named values that don t match any column names Google Cloud Bigtable: This setting is ignored. Google Cloud Datastore backups: This setting is ignored. Avro: This setting is ignored.    max-bad-records=18  [Optional] The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery can ignore when reading data. If the number of bad records exceeds this value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. This is only valid for CSV, JSON, and Google Sheets. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid. This setting is ignored for Google Cloud Bigtable, Google Cloud Datastore backups and Avro formats.    source-format=elitr  [Required] The data format. For CSV files, specify  CSV . For Google sheets, specify  GOOGLE_SHEETS . For newline-delimited JSON, specify  NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON . For Avro files, specify  AVRO .

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level. E.g. \n...\n would go three levels up.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Output Flags\n\n\nThe method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.\n\n\n\n\n-o out\n\n\nout\n specifies the \ndestination\n to which to write the server's result to.\n  It will be a JSON-encoded structure.\n  The \ndestination\n may be \n-\n to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.\n  If unset, it defaults to standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional General Properties\n\n\nThe following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p alt=string\n\n\n\n\nData format for the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p fields=string\n\n\n\n\nSelector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p key=string\n\n\n\n\nAPI key.

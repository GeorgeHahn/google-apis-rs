You can change the directory used to store configuration with the \n--config-dir\n flag on a per-invocation basis.\n\n\nMore information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMost APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the \nscope\n determines the \nset of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/bigquery2-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/bigquery2-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \nbigquery\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \nbigquery2 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.   -r .    creation-time=aliquyam  [Output-only] The time when this dataset was created, in milliseconds since the epoch.    dataset-reference    dataset-id=sea  [Required] A unique ID for this dataset, without the project name. The ID must contain only letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), or underscores (_). The maximum length is 1,024 characters.     project-id=lorem   [Optional] The ID of the project containing this dataset.     ..default-encryption-configuration    kms-key-name=eos   [Optional] Describes the Cloud KMS encryption key that will be used to protect destination BigQuery table. The BigQuery Service Account associated with your project requires access to this encryption key.     ..    default-partition-expiration-ms=erat   [Optional] The default partition expiration for all partitioned tables in the dataset, in milliseconds. Once this property is set, all newly-created partitioned tables in the dataset will have an expirationMs property in the timePartitioning settings set to this value, and changing the value will only affect new tables, not existing ones. The storage in a partition will have an expiration time of its partition time plus this value. Setting this property overrides the use of defaultTableExpirationMs for partitioned tables: only one of defaultTableExpirationMs and defaultPartitionExpirationMs will be used for any new partitioned table. If you provide an explicit timePartitioning.expirationMs when creating or updating a partitioned table, that value takes precedence over the default partition expiration time indicated by this property.    default-table-expiration-ms=sadipscing  [Optional] The default lifetime of all tables in the dataset, in milliseconds. The minimum value is 3600000 milliseconds (one hour). Once this property is set, all newly-created tables in the dataset will have an expirationTime property set to the creation time plus the value in this property, and changing the value will only affect new tables, not existing ones. When the expirationTime for a given table is reached, that table will be deleted automatically. If a table s expirationTime is modified or removed before the table expires, or if you provide an explicit expirationTime when creating a table, that value takes precedence over the default expiration time indicated by this property.    description=dolor  [Optional] A user-friendly description of the dataset.    etag=eirmod  [Output-only] A hash of the resource.    friendly-name=elitr  [Optional] A descriptive name for the dataset.    id=amet  [Output-only] The fully-qualified unique name of the dataset in the format projectId:datasetId. The dataset name without the project name is given in the datasetId field. When creating a new dataset, leave this field blank, and instead specify the datasetId field.    kind=no  [Output-only] The resource type.    labels=key=labore  The labels associated with this dataset. You can use these to organize and group your datasets. You can set this property when inserting or updating a dataset. See Creating and Updating Dataset Labels for more information.  the value will be associated with the given  key    last-modified-time=eirmod  [Output-only] The date when this dataset or any of its tables was last modified, in milliseconds since the epoch.    location=dolore  The geographic location where the dataset should reside. The default value is US. See details at https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations.    self-link=invidunt  [Output-only] A URL that can be used to access the resource again. You can use this URL in Get or Update requests to the resource.",

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with  . , e.g.  -r .s.s  You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly.

The following values are supported: WRITE_TRUNCATE: If the table already exists, BigQuery overwrites the table data. WRITE_APPEND: If the table already exists, BigQuery appends the data to the table. WRITE_EMPTY: If the table already exists and contains data, a \nduplicate\n error is returned in the job result. The default value is WRITE_EMPTY. Each action is atomic and only occurs if BigQuery is able to complete the job successfully. Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    dry-run=true\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] If set, don\nt actually run this job. A valid query will return a mostly empty response with some processing statistics, while an invalid query will return the same error it would if it wasn\nt a dry run. Behavior of non-query jobs is undefined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nextract    compression=amet\n\n\n[Optional] The compression type to use for exported files.

The supported values are UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1. The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfield-delimiter=consetetur\n\n\n[Optional] The separator for fields in a CSV file. The separator can be any ISO-8859-1 single-byte character. To use a character in the range 128-255, you must encode the character as UTF8. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence \n\\t\n to specify a tab separator. The default value is a comma (\n,\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhive-partitioning-mode=dolore\n\n\n[Optional, Trusted Tester] If hive partitioning is enabled, which mode to use. Two modes are supported: - AUTO: automatically infer partition key name(s) and type(s). - STRINGS: automatic infer partition key name(s). All types are strings. Not all storage formats support hive partitioning -- requesting hive partitioning on an unsupported format will lead to an error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhive-partitioning-options    mode=duo\n\n\n[Optional, Trusted Tester] When set, what mode of hive partitioning to use when reading data. Two modes are supported. (1) AUTO: automatically infer partition key name(s) and type(s). (2) STRINGS: automatically infer partition key name(s). All types are interpreted as strings. Not all storage formats support hive partitioning. Requesting hive partitioning on an unsupported format will lead to an error. Currently supported types include: AVRO, CSV, JSON, ORC and Parquet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsource-uri-prefix=aliquyam\n\n\n\n\n[Optional, Trusted Tester] When hive partition detection is requested, a common prefix for all source uris should be supplied. The prefix must end immediately before the partition key encoding begins. For example, consider files following this data layout. gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-01-01/country=BR/id=7/file.avro gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2018-12-31/country=CA/id=3/file.avro When hive partitioning is requested with either AUTO or STRINGS detection, the common prefix can be either of gs://bucket/path_to_table or gs://bucket/path_to_table/ (trailing slash does not matter).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    ignore-unknown-values=true\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema. If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value: CSV: Trailing columns JSON: Named values that don\nt match any column names\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmax-bad-records=84\n\n\n[Optional] The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery can ignore when running the job. If the number of bad records exceeds this value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. This is only valid for CSV and JSON. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnull-marker=clita\n\n\n[Optional] Specifies a string that represents a null value in a CSV file. For example, if you specify \n\\N\n, BigQuery interprets \n\\N\n as a null value when loading a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as an empty value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprojection-fields=consetetur\n\n\nIf sourceFormat is set to \nDATASTORE_BACKUP\n, indicates which entity properties to load into BigQuery from a Cloud Datastore backup. Property names are case sensitive and must be top-level properties. If no properties are specified, BigQuery loads all properties. If any named property isn\nt found in the Cloud Datastore backup, an invalid error is returned in the job result.\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nquote=takimata\n\n\n[Optional] The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote (\n). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrange-partitioning    field=nonumy\n\n\n[TrustedTester] [Required] The table is partitioned by this field. The field must be a top-level NULLABLE/REQUIRED field. The only supported type is INTEGER/INT64.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrange    end=kasd\n\n\n[TrustedTester] [Required] The end of range partitioning, exclusive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninterval=sanctus\n\n\n[TrustedTester] [Required] The width of each interval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstart=takimata\n\n\n\n\n[TrustedTester] [Required] The start of range partitioning, inclusive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...    schema-inline=at\n\n\n\n\n[Deprecated] The inline schema. For CSV schemas, specify as \nField1:Type1[,Field2:Type2]*\n. For example, \nfoo:STRING, bar:INTEGER, baz:FLOAT\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nschema-inline-format=labore\n\n\n[Deprecated] The format of the schemaInline property.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nschema-update-options=invidunt\n\n\nAllows the schema of the destination table to be updated as a side effect of the load job if a schema is autodetected or supplied in the job configuration. Schema update options are supported in two cases: when writeDisposition is WRITE_APPEND; when writeDisposition is WRITE_TRUNCATE and the destination table is a partition of a table, specified by partition decorators. For normal tables, WRITE_TRUNCATE will always overwrite the schema. One or more of the following values are specified: ALLOW_FIELD_ADDITION: allow adding a nullable field to the schema. ALLOW_FIELD_RELAXATION: allow relaxing a required field in the original schema to nullable.\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskip-leading-rows=35\n\n\n[Optional] The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when loading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsource-format=sadipscing\n\n\n[Optional] The format of the data files. For CSV files, specify \nCSV\n. For datastore backups, specify \nDATASTORE_BACKUP\n. For newline-delimited JSON, specify \nNEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON\n. For Avro, specify \nAVRO\n. For parquet, specify \nPARQUET\n. For orc, specify \nORC\n. The default value is CSV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsource-uris=rebum.\n\n\n[Required] The fully-qualified URIs that point to your data in Google Cloud. For Google Cloud Storage URIs: Each URI can contain one \n wildcard character and it must come after the \nbucket\n name. Size limits related to load jobs apply to external data sources. For Google Cloud Bigtable URIs: Exactly one URI can be specified and it has be a fully specified and valid HTTPS URL for a Google Cloud Bigtable table. For Google Cloud Datastore backups: Exactly one URI can be specified. Also, the \n wildcard character is not allowed.\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntime-partitioning    expiration-ms=dolore\n\n\n[Optional] Number of milliseconds for which to keep the storage for partitions in the table. The storage in a partition will have an expiration time of its partition time plus this value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfield=nonumy\n\n\n[Beta] [Optional] If not set, the table is partitioned by pseudo column, referenced via either \n_PARTITIONTIME\n as TIMESTAMP type, or \n_PARTITIONDATE\n as DATE type. If field is specified, the table is instead partitioned by this field. The field must be a top-level TIMESTAMP or DATE field. Its mode must be NULLABLE or REQUIRED.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequire-partition-filter=true\n\n\nNo description provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntype=aliquyam\n\n\n\n\n[Required] The only type supported is DAY, which will generate one partition per day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    use-avro-logical-types=false\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] If sourceFormat is set to \nAVRO\n, indicates whether to enable interpreting logical types into their corresponding types (ie. TIMESTAMP), instead of only using their raw types (ie. INTEGER).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwrite-disposition=eirmod\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] Specifies the action that occurs if the destination table already exists. The following values are supported: WRITE_TRUNCATE: If the table already exists, BigQuery overwrites the table data. WRITE_APPEND: If the table already exists, BigQuery appends the data to the table. WRITE_EMPTY: If the table already exists and contains data, a \nduplicate\n error is returned in the job result. The default value is WRITE_APPEND. Each action is atomic and only occurs if BigQuery is able to complete the job successfully. Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..query    allow-large-results=true\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] If true and query uses legacy SQL dialect, allows the query to produce arbitrarily large result tables at a slight cost in performance. Requires destinationTable to be set. For standard SQL queries, this flag is ignored and large results are always allowed. However, you must still set destinationTable when result size exceeds the allowed maximum response size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclustering    fields=labore\n\n\n\n\n[Repeated] One or more fields on which data should be clustered. Only top-level, non-repeated, simple-type fields are supported. When you cluster a table using multiple columns, the order of columns you specify is important.

Schema update options are supported in two cases: when writeDisposition is WRITE_APPEND; when writeDisposition is WRITE_TRUNCATE and the destination table is a partition of a table, specified by partition decorators. For normal tables, WRITE_TRUNCATE will always overwrite the schema. One or more of the following values are specified: ALLOW_FIELD_ADDITION: allow adding a nullable field to the schema. ALLOW_FIELD_RELAXATION: allow relaxing a required field in the original schema to nullable.\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntime-partitioning    expiration-ms=diam\n\n\n[Optional] Number of milliseconds for which to keep the storage for partitions in the table.

The default value is true. If set to false, the query will use BigQuery\ns standard SQL: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/sql-reference/ When useLegacySql is set to false, the value of flattenResults is ignored; query will be run as if flattenResults is false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuse-query-cache=false\n\n\n[Optional] Whether to look for the result in the query cache. The query cache is a best-effort cache that will be flushed whenever tables in the query are modified. Moreover, the query cache is only available when a query does not have a destination table specified. The default value is true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwrite-disposition=dolores\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] Specifies the action that occurs if the destination table already exists. The following values are supported: WRITE_TRUNCATE: If the table already exists, BigQuery overwrites the table data and uses the schema from the query result. WRITE_APPEND: If the table already exists, BigQuery appends the data to the table. WRITE_EMPTY: If the table already exists and contains data, a \nduplicate\n error is returned in the job result. The default value is WRITE_EMPTY. Each action is atomic and only occurs if BigQuery is able to complete the job successfully. Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...    etag=eos\n\n\n\n\n[Output-only] A hash of this resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid=voluptua.\n\n\n[Output-only] Opaque ID field of the job\n\n\n\n\n\n\njob-reference    job-id=duo\n\n\n[Required] The ID of the job.

The supported values are UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1. The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.    field-delimiter=consetetur  [Optional] The separator for fields in a CSV file. The separator can be any ISO-8859-1 single-byte character. To use a character in the range 128-255, you must encode the character as UTF8. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence  \\t  to specify a tab separator. The default value is a comma ( , ).    hive-partitioning-mode=dolore  [Optional, Trusted Tester] If hive partitioning is enabled, which mode to use. Two modes are supported: - AUTO: automatically infer partition key name(s) and type(s). - STRINGS: automatic infer partition key name(s). All types are strings. Not all storage formats support hive partitioning -- requesting hive partitioning on an unsupported format will lead to an error.    hive-partitioning-options    mode=duo  [Optional, Trusted Tester] When set, what mode of hive partitioning to use when reading data. Two modes are supported. (1) AUTO: automatically infer partition key name(s) and type(s). (2) STRINGS: automatically infer partition key name(s). All types are interpreted as strings.

If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value: CSV: Trailing columns JSON: Named values that don t match any column names    max-bad-records=84  [Optional] The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery can ignore when running the job. If the number of bad records exceeds this value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. This is only valid for CSV and JSON. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid.    null-marker=clita  [Optional] Specifies a string that represents a null value in a CSV file. For example, if you specify  \\N , BigQuery interprets  \\N  as a null value when loading a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as an empty value.    projection-fields=consetetur  If sourceFormat is set to  DATASTORE_BACKUP , indicates which entity properties to load into BigQuery from a Cloud Datastore backup. Property names are case sensitive and must be top-level properties. If no properties are specified, BigQuery loads all properties. If any named property isn t found in the Cloud Datastore backup, an invalid error is returned in the job result.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    quote=takimata  [Optional] The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote ( ). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true.    range-partitioning    field=nonumy  [TrustedTester] [Required] The table is partitioned by this field.

Schema update options are supported in two cases: when writeDisposition is WRITE_APPEND; when writeDisposition is WRITE_TRUNCATE and the destination table is a partition of a table, specified by partition decorators. For normal tables, WRITE_TRUNCATE will always overwrite the schema. One or more of the following values are specified: ALLOW_FIELD_ADDITION: allow adding a nullable field to the schema. ALLOW_FIELD_RELAXATION: allow relaxing a required field in the original schema to nullable.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    skip-leading-rows=35  [Optional] The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when loading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped.    source-format=sadipscing  [Optional] The format of the data files. For CSV files, specify  CSV . For datastore backups, specify  DATASTORE_BACKUP . For newline-delimited JSON, specify  NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON . For Avro, specify  AVRO .

If field is specified, the table is instead partitioned by this field. The field must be a top-level TIMESTAMP or DATE field. Its mode must be NULLABLE or REQUIRED.    require-partition-filter=true  No description provided.     type=aliquyam   [Required] The only type supported is DAY, which will generate one partition per day.     ..    use-avro-logical-types=false   [Optional] If sourceFormat is set to  AVRO , indicates whether to enable interpreting logical types into their corresponding types (ie. TIMESTAMP), instead of only using their raw types (ie. INTEGER).     write-disposition=eirmod   [Optional] Specifies the action that occurs if the destination table already exists. The following values are supported: WRITE_TRUNCATE: If the table already exists, BigQuery overwrites the table data. WRITE_APPEND: If the table already exists, BigQuery appends the data to the table. WRITE_EMPTY: If the table already exists and contains data, a  duplicate  error is returned in the job result. The default value is WRITE_APPEND. Each action is atomic and only occurs if BigQuery is able to complete the job successfully. Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion.     ..query    allow-large-results=true   [Optional] If true and query uses legacy SQL dialect, allows the query to produce arbitrarily large result tables at a slight cost in performance.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-r .clustering    fields=vero\n\n\n\n\n[Repeated] One or more fields on which data should be clustered. Only top-level, non-repeated, simple-type fields are supported. When you cluster a table using multiple columns, the order of columns you specify is important. The order of the specified columns determines the sort order of the data.\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    creation-time=consetetur\n\n\n\n\n[Output-only] The time when this table was created, in milliseconds since the epoch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndescription=eos\n\n\n[Optional] A user-friendly description of this table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nencryption-configuration    kms-key-name=justo\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] Describes the Cloud KMS encryption key that will be used to protect destination BigQuery table. The BigQuery Service Account associated with your project requires access to this encryption key.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    etag=tempor\n\n\n\n\n[Output-only] A hash of the table metadata.

Not guaranteed to change when the table contents or the fields numRows, numBytes, numLongTermBytes or lastModifiedTime change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexpiration-time=gubergren\n\n\n[Optional] The time when this table expires, in milliseconds since the epoch. If not present, the table will persist indefinitely. Expired tables will be deleted and their storage reclaimed. The defaultTableExpirationMs property of the encapsulating dataset can be used to set a default expirationTime on newly created tables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexternal-data-configuration    autodetect=false\n\n\nTry to detect schema and format options automatically. Any option specified explicitly will be honored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbigtable-options    ignore-unspecified-column-families=false\n\n\n[Optional] If field is true, then the column families that are not specified in columnFamilies list are not exposed in the table schema. Otherwise, they are read with BYTES type values. The default value is false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nread-rowkey-as-string=true\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] If field is true, then the rowkey column families will be read and converted to string. Otherwise they are read with BYTES type values and users need to manually cast them with CAST if necessary. The default value is false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    compression=magna\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] The compression type of the data source. Possible values include GZIP and NONE. The default value is NONE. This setting is ignored for Google Cloud Bigtable, Google Cloud Datastore backups and Avro formats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncsv-options    allow-jagged-rows=false\n\n\n[Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should accept rows that are missing trailing optional columns. If true, BigQuery treats missing trailing columns as null values. If false, records with missing trailing columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nallow-quoted-newlines=false\n\n\n[Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow quoted data sections that contain newline characters in a CSV file. The default value is false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nencoding=ipsum\n\n\n[Optional] The character encoding of the data. The supported values are UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1. The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfield-delimiter=invidunt\n\n\n[Optional] The separator for fields in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence \n\\t\n to specify a tab separator. The default value is a comma (\n,\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nquote=accusam\n\n\n[Optional] The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote (\n). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskip-leading-rows=labore\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..google-sheets-options    range=diam\n\n\n\n\n[Beta] [Optional] Range of a sheet to query from. Only used when non-empty. Typical format: sheet_name!top_left_cell_id:bottom_right_cell_id For example: sheet1!A1:B20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskip-leading-rows=nonumy\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] The number of rows at the top of a sheet that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N \n 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    hive-partitioning-mode=sed\n\n\n\n\n[Optional, Trusted Tester] If hive partitioning is enabled, which mode to use. Two modes are supported: - AUTO: automatically infer partition key name(s) and type(s). - STRINGS: automatic infer partition key name(s). All types are strings. Not all storage formats support hive partitioning -- requesting hive partitioning on an unsupported format will lead to an error. Note: this setting is in the process of being deprecated in favor of hivePartitioningOptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhive-partitioning-options    mode=diam\n\n\n[Optional, Trusted Tester] When set, what mode of hive partitioning to use when reading data. Two modes are supported. (1) AUTO: automatically infer partition key name(s) and type(s). (2) STRINGS: automatically infer partition key name(s). All types are interpreted as strings. Not all storage formats support hive partitioning. Requesting hive partitioning on an unsupported format will lead to an error. Currently supported types include: AVRO, CSV, JSON, ORC and Parquet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsource-uri-prefix=magna\n\n\n\n\n[Optional, Trusted Tester] When hive partition detection is requested, a common prefix for all source uris should be supplied. The prefix must end immediately before the partition key encoding begins. For example, consider files following this data layout. gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-01-01/country=BR/id=7/file.avro gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2018-12-31/country=CA/id=3/file.avro When hive partitioning is requested with either AUTO or STRINGS detection, the common prefix can be either of gs://bucket/path_to_table or gs://bucket/path_to_table/ (trailing slash does not matter).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    ignore-unknown-values=false\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema. If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value: CSV: Trailing columns JSON: Named values that don\nt match any column names Google Cloud Bigtable: This setting is ignored. Google Cloud Datastore backups: This setting is ignored. Avro: This setting is ignored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmax-bad-records=96\n\n\n[Optional] The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery can ignore when reading data. If the number of bad records exceeds this value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. This is only valid for CSV, JSON, and Google Sheets. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid. This setting is ignored for Google Cloud Bigtable, Google Cloud Datastore backups and Avro formats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsource-format=dolor\n\n\n[Required] The data format. For CSV files, specify \nCSV\n. For Google sheets, specify \nGOOGLE_SHEETS\n. For newline-delimited JSON, specify \nNEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON\n. For Avro files, specify \nAVRO\n. For Google Cloud Datastore backups, specify \nDATASTORE_BACKUP\n. [Beta] For Google Cloud Bigtable, specify \nBIGTABLE\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsource-uris=vero\n\n\n\n\n[Required] The fully-qualified URIs that point to your data in Google Cloud. For Google Cloud Storage URIs: Each URI can contain one \n wildcard character and it must come after the \nbucket\n name. Size limits related to load jobs apply to external data sources. For Google Cloud Bigtable URIs: Exactly one URI can be specified and it has be a fully specified and valid HTTPS URL for a Google Cloud Bigtable table. For Google Cloud Datastore backups, exactly one URI can be specified. Also, the \n wildcard character is not allowed.\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    friendly-name=nonumy\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] A descriptive name for this table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid=takimata\n\n\n[Output-only] An opaque ID uniquely identifying the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkind=dolores\n\n\n[Output-only] The type of the resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlabels=key=consetetur\n\n\nThe labels associated with this table. You can use these to organize and group your tables. Label keys and values can be no longer than 63 characters, can only contain lowercase letters, numeric characters, underscores and dashes.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.    -r .clustering    fields=vero   [Repeated] One or more fields on which data should be clustered. Only top-level, non-repeated, simple-type fields are supported. When you cluster a table using multiple columns, the order of columns you specify is important. The order of the specified columns determines the sort order of the data.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.     ..    creation-time=consetetur   [Output-only] The time when this table was created, in milliseconds since the epoch.    description=eos  [Optional] A user-friendly description of this table.     encryption-configuration    kms-key-name=justo   [Optional] Describes the Cloud KMS encryption key that will be used to protect destination BigQuery table. The BigQuery Service Account associated with your project requires access to this encryption key.     ..    etag=tempor   [Output-only] A hash of the table metadata. Used to ensure there were no concurrent modifications to the resource when attempting an update. Not guaranteed to change when the table contents or the fields numRows, numBytes, numLongTermBytes or lastModifiedTime change.    expiration-time=gubergren  [Optional] The time when this table expires, in milliseconds since the epoch. If not present, the table will persist indefinitely. Expired tables will be deleted and their storage reclaimed. The defaultTableExpirationMs property of the encapsulating dataset can be used to set a default expirationTime on newly created tables.    external-data-configuration    autodetect=false  Try to detect schema and format options automatically. Any option specified explicitly will be honored.    bigtable-options    ignore-unspecified-column-families=false  [Optional] If field is true, then the column families that are not specified in columnFamilies list are not exposed in the table schema. Otherwise, they are read with BYTES type values. The default value is false.     read-rowkey-as-string=true   [Optional] If field is true, then the rowkey column families will be read and converted to string. Otherwise they are read with BYTES type values and users need to manually cast them with CAST if necessary. The default value is false.     ..    compression=magna   [Optional] The compression type of the data source. Possible values include GZIP and NONE. The default value is NONE. This setting is ignored for Google Cloud Bigtable, Google Cloud Datastore backups and Avro formats.    csv-options    allow-jagged-rows=false  [Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should accept rows that are missing trailing optional columns. If true, BigQuery treats missing trailing columns as null values. If false, records with missing trailing columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false.    allow-quoted-newlines=false  [Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow quoted data sections that contain newline characters in a CSV file. The default value is false.    encoding=ipsum  [Optional] The character encoding of the data. The supported values are UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1. The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.    field-delimiter=invidunt  [Optional] The separator for fields in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence  \\t  to specify a tab separator. The default value is a comma ( , ).    quote=accusam  [Optional] The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote ( ). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true.     skip-leading-rows=labore   [Optional] The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped.     ..google-sheets-options    range=diam   [Beta] [Optional] Range of a sheet to query from. Only used when non-empty. Typical format: sheet_name!top_left_cell_id:bottom_right_cell_id For example: sheet1!A1:B20     skip-leading-rows=nonumy   [Optional] The number of rows at the top of a sheet that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N   0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.     ..    hive-partitioning-mode=sed   [Optional, Trusted Tester] If hive partitioning is enabled, which mode to use. Two modes are supported: - AUTO: automatically infer partition key name(s) and type(s). - STRINGS: automatic infer partition key name(s). All types are strings. Not all storage formats support hive partitioning -- requesting hive partitioning on an unsupported format will lead to an error. Note: this setting is in the process of being deprecated in favor of hivePartitioningOptions.    hive-partitioning-options    mode=diam  [Optional, Trusted Tester] When set, what mode of hive partitioning to use when reading data. Two modes are supported. (1) AUTO: automatically infer partition key name(s) and type(s). (2) STRINGS: automatically infer partition key name(s). All types are interpreted as strings. Not all storage formats support hive partitioning. Requesting hive partitioning on an unsupported format will lead to an error. Currently supported types include: AVRO, CSV, JSON, ORC and Parquet.     source-uri-prefix=magna   [Optional, Trusted Tester] When hive partition detection is requested, a common prefix for all source uris should be supplied. The prefix must end immediately before the partition key encoding begins. For example, consider files following this data layout. gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-01-01/country=BR/id=7/file.avro gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2018-12-31/country=CA/id=3/file.avro When hive partitioning is requested with either AUTO or STRINGS detection, the common prefix can be either of gs://bucket/path_to_table or gs://bucket/path_to_table/ (trailing slash does not matter).     ..    ignore-unknown-values=false   [Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema. If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value: CSV: Trailing columns JSON: Named values that don t match any column names Google Cloud Bigtable: This setting is ignored. Google Cloud Datastore backups: This setting is ignored. Avro: This setting is ignored.    max-bad-records=96  [Optional] The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery can ignore when reading data. If the number of bad records exceeds this value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. This is only valid for CSV, JSON, and Google Sheets. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid. This setting is ignored for Google Cloud Bigtable, Google Cloud Datastore backups and Avro formats.    source-format=dolor  [Required] The data format. For CSV files, specify  CSV . For Google sheets, specify  GOOGLE_SHEETS . For newline-delimited JSON, specify  NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON . For Avro files, specify  AVRO . For Google Cloud Datastore backups, specify  DATASTORE_BACKUP . [Beta] For Google Cloud Bigtable, specify  BIGTABLE .     source-uris=vero   [Required] The fully-qualified URIs that point to your data in Google Cloud. For Google Cloud Storage URIs: Each URI can contain one   wildcard character and it must come after the  bucket  name. Size limits related to load jobs apply to external data sources. For Google Cloud Bigtable URIs: Exactly one URI can be specified and it has be a fully specified and valid HTTPS URL for a Google Cloud Bigtable table. For Google Cloud Datastore backups, exactly one URI can be specified. Also, the   wildcard character is not allowed.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.     ..    friendly-name=nonumy   [Optional] A descriptive name for this table.    id=takimata  [Output-only] An opaque ID uniquely identifying the table.    kind=dolores  [Output-only] The type of the resource.    labels=key=consetetur  The labels associated with this table.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-r .clustering    fields=at\n\n\n\n\n[Repeated] One or more fields on which data should be clustered. Only top-level, non-repeated, simple-type fields are supported. When you cluster a table using multiple columns, the order of columns you specify is important. The order of the specified columns determines the sort order of the data.\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    creation-time=sit\n\n\n\n\n[Output-only] The time when this table was created, in milliseconds since the epoch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndescription=ut\n\n\n[Optional] A user-friendly description of this table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nencryption-configuration    kms-key-name=diam\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] Describes the Cloud KMS encryption key that will be used to protect destination BigQuery table. The BigQuery Service Account associated with your project requires access to this encryption key.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    etag=tempor\n\n\n\n\n[Output-only] A hash of the table metadata. Used to ensure there were no concurrent modifications to the resource when attempting an update. Not guaranteed to change when the table contents or the fields numRows, numBytes, numLongTermBytes or lastModifiedTime change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexpiration-time=et\n\n\n[Optional] The time when this table expires, in milliseconds since the epoch. If not present, the table will persist indefinitely. Expired tables will be deleted and their storage reclaimed. The defaultTableExpirationMs property of the encapsulating dataset can be used to set a default expirationTime on newly created tables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexternal-data-configuration    autodetect=false\n\n\nTry to detect schema and format options automatically. Any option specified explicitly will be honored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbigtable-options    ignore-unspecified-column-families=true\n\n\n[Optional] If field is true, then the column families that are not specified in columnFamilies list are not exposed in the table schema. Otherwise, they are read with BYTES type values. The default value is false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nread-rowkey-as-string=false\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] If field is true, then the rowkey column families will be read and converted to string. Otherwise they are read with BYTES type values and users need to manually cast them with CAST if necessary. The default value is false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    compression=et\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] The compression type of the data source. Possible values include GZIP and NONE. The default value is NONE. This setting is ignored for Google Cloud Bigtable, Google Cloud Datastore backups and Avro formats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncsv-options    allow-jagged-rows=false\n\n\n[Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should accept rows that are missing trailing optional columns. If true, BigQuery treats missing trailing columns as null values. If false, records with missing trailing columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nallow-quoted-newlines=false\n\n\n[Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow quoted data sections that contain newline characters in a CSV file. The default value is false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nencoding=dolores\n\n\n[Optional] The character encoding of the data. The supported values are UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1. The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfield-delimiter=clita\n\n\n[Optional] The separator for fields in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence \n\\t\n to specify a tab separator. The default value is a comma (\n,\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nquote=eos\n\n\n[Optional] The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote (\n). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskip-leading-rows=amet\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..google-sheets-options    range=sed\n\n\n\n\n[Beta] [Optional] Range of a sheet to query from. Only used when non-empty. Typical format: sheet_name!top_left_cell_id:bottom_right_cell_id For example: sheet1!A1:B20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskip-leading-rows=takimata\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] The number of rows at the top of a sheet that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N \n 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    hive-partitioning-mode=sit\n\n\n\n\n[Optional, Trusted Tester] If hive partitioning is enabled, which mode to use. Two modes are supported: - AUTO: automatically infer partition key name(s) and type(s). - STRINGS: automatic infer partition key name(s). All types are strings. Not all storage formats support hive partitioning -- requesting hive partitioning on an unsupported format will lead to an error. Note: this setting is in the process of being deprecated in favor of hivePartitioningOptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhive-partitioning-options    mode=labore\n\n\n[Optional, Trusted Tester] When set, what mode of hive partitioning to use when reading data. Two modes are supported. (1) AUTO: automatically infer partition key name(s) and type(s). (2) STRINGS: automatically infer partition key name(s). All types are interpreted as strings. Not all storage formats support hive partitioning. Requesting hive partitioning on an unsupported format will lead to an error. Currently supported types include: AVRO, CSV, JSON, ORC and Parquet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsource-uri-prefix=nonumy\n\n\n\n\n[Optional, Trusted Tester] When hive partition detection is requested, a common prefix for all source uris should be supplied. The prefix must end immediately before the partition key encoding begins. For example, consider files following this data layout. gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-01-01/country=BR/id=7/file.avro gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2018-12-31/country=CA/id=3/file.avro When hive partitioning is requested with either AUTO or STRINGS detection, the common prefix can be either of gs://bucket/path_to_table or gs://bucket/path_to_table/ (trailing slash does not matter).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    ignore-unknown-values=false\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema. If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value: CSV: Trailing columns JSON: Named values that don\nt match any column names Google Cloud Bigtable: This setting is ignored. Google Cloud Datastore backups: This setting is ignored. Avro: This setting is ignored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmax-bad-records=90\n\n\n[Optional] The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery can ignore when reading data. If the number of bad records exceeds this value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. This is only valid for CSV, JSON, and Google Sheets. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid. This setting is ignored for Google Cloud Bigtable, Google Cloud Datastore backups and Avro formats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsource-format=erat\n\n\n[Required] The data format. For CSV files, specify \nCSV\n. For Google sheets, specify \nGOOGLE_SHEETS\n. For newline-delimited JSON, specify \nNEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON\n. For Avro files, specify \nAVRO\n. For Google Cloud Datastore backups, specify \nDATASTORE_BACKUP\n. [Beta] For Google Cloud Bigtable, specify \nBIGTABLE\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsource-uris=et\n\n\n\n\n[Required] The fully-qualified URIs that point to your data in Google Cloud.

For Google Cloud Bigtable URIs: Exactly one URI can be specified and it has be a fully specified and valid HTTPS URL for a Google Cloud Bigtable table. For Google Cloud Datastore backups, exactly one URI can be specified. Also, the \n wildcard character is not allowed.\n\n\nEach invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    friendly-name=amet\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] A descriptive name for this table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid=lorem\n\n\n[Output-only] An opaque ID uniquely identifying the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkind=voluptua.\n\n\n[Output-only] The type of the resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlabels=key=rebum.\n\n\nThe labels associated with this table. You can use these to organize and group your tables. Label keys and values can be no longer than 63 characters, can only contain lowercase letters, numeric characters, underscores and dashes. International characters are allowed. Label values are optional. Label keys must start with a letter and each label in the list must have a different key.\n\n\nthe value will be associated with the given \nkey\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlast-modified-time=justo\n\n\n[Output-only] The time when this table was last modified, in milliseconds since the epoch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlocation=labore\n\n\n[Output-only] The geographic location where the table resides.

The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.    -r .clustering    fields=at   [Repeated] One or more fields on which data should be clustered. Only top-level, non-repeated, simple-type fields are supported. When you cluster a table using multiple columns, the order of columns you specify is important. The order of the specified columns determines the sort order of the data.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.     ..    creation-time=sit   [Output-only] The time when this table was created, in milliseconds since the epoch.    description=ut  [Optional] A user-friendly description of this table.     encryption-configuration    kms-key-name=diam   [Optional] Describes the Cloud KMS encryption key that will be used to protect destination BigQuery table. The BigQuery Service Account associated with your project requires access to this encryption key.     ..    etag=tempor   [Output-only] A hash of the table metadata. Used to ensure there were no concurrent modifications to the resource when attempting an update. Not guaranteed to change when the table contents or the fields numRows, numBytes, numLongTermBytes or lastModifiedTime change.    expiration-time=et  [Optional] The time when this table expires, in milliseconds since the epoch. If not present, the table will persist indefinitely. Expired tables will be deleted and their storage reclaimed. The defaultTableExpirationMs property of the encapsulating dataset can be used to set a default expirationTime on newly created tables.    external-data-configuration    autodetect=false  Try to detect schema and format options automatically. Any option specified explicitly will be honored.    bigtable-options    ignore-unspecified-column-families=true  [Optional] If field is true, then the column families that are not specified in columnFamilies list are not exposed in the table schema. Otherwise, they are read with BYTES type values. The default value is false.     read-rowkey-as-string=false   [Optional] If field is true, then the rowkey column families will be read and converted to string. Otherwise they are read with BYTES type values and users need to manually cast them with CAST if necessary. The default value is false.     ..    compression=et   [Optional] The compression type of the data source. Possible values include GZIP and NONE. The default value is NONE. This setting is ignored for Google Cloud Bigtable, Google Cloud Datastore backups and Avro formats.    csv-options    allow-jagged-rows=false  [Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should accept rows that are missing trailing optional columns. If true, BigQuery treats missing trailing columns as null values. If false, records with missing trailing columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false.    allow-quoted-newlines=false  [Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow quoted data sections that contain newline characters in a CSV file. The default value is false.    encoding=dolores  [Optional] The character encoding of the data. The supported values are UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1. The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.    field-delimiter=clita  [Optional] The separator for fields in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence  \\t  to specify a tab separator. The default value is a comma ( , ).    quote=eos  [Optional] The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote ( ). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true.     skip-leading-rows=amet   [Optional] The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped.     ..google-sheets-options    range=sed   [Beta] [Optional] Range of a sheet to query from. Only used when non-empty. Typical format: sheet_name!top_left_cell_id:bottom_right_cell_id For example: sheet1!A1:B20     skip-leading-rows=takimata   [Optional] The number of rows at the top of a sheet that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N   0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.     ..    hive-partitioning-mode=sit   [Optional, Trusted Tester] If hive partitioning is enabled, which mode to use. Two modes are supported: - AUTO: automatically infer partition key name(s) and type(s). - STRINGS: automatic infer partition key name(s). All types are strings. Not all storage formats support hive partitioning -- requesting hive partitioning on an unsupported format will lead to an error. Note: this setting is in the process of being deprecated in favor of hivePartitioningOptions.    hive-partitioning-options    mode=labore  [Optional, Trusted Tester] When set, what mode of hive partitioning to use when reading data. Two modes are supported. (1) AUTO: automatically infer partition key name(s) and type(s). (2) STRINGS: automatically infer partition key name(s). All types are interpreted as strings. Not all storage formats support hive partitioning. Requesting hive partitioning on an unsupported format will lead to an error. Currently supported types include: AVRO, CSV, JSON, ORC and Parquet.     source-uri-prefix=nonumy   [Optional, Trusted Tester] When hive partition detection is requested, a common prefix for all source uris should be supplied. The prefix must end immediately before the partition key encoding begins. For example, consider files following this data layout. gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-01-01/country=BR/id=7/file.avro gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2018-12-31/country=CA/id=3/file.avro When hive partitioning is requested with either AUTO or STRINGS detection, the common prefix can be either of gs://bucket/path_to_table or gs://bucket/path_to_table/ (trailing slash does not matter).     ..    ignore-unknown-values=false   [Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema. If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value: CSV: Trailing columns JSON: Named values that don t match any column names Google Cloud Bigtable: This setting is ignored. Google Cloud Datastore backups: This setting is ignored. Avro: This setting is ignored.    max-bad-records=90  [Optional] The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery can ignore when reading data. If the number of bad records exceeds this value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. This is only valid for CSV, JSON, and Google Sheets. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid. This setting is ignored for Google Cloud Bigtable, Google Cloud Datastore backups and Avro formats.    source-format=erat  [Required] The data format. For CSV files, specify  CSV . For Google sheets, specify  GOOGLE_SHEETS . For newline-delimited JSON, specify  NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON . For Avro files, specify  AVRO . For Google Cloud Datastore backups, specify  DATASTORE_BACKUP . [Beta] For Google Cloud Bigtable, specify  BIGTABLE .     source-uris=et   [Required] The fully-qualified URIs that point to your data in Google Cloud. For Google Cloud Storage URIs: Each URI can contain one   wildcard character and it must come after the  bucket  name. Size limits related to load jobs apply to external data sources. For Google Cloud Bigtable URIs: Exactly one URI can be specified and it has be a fully specified and valid HTTPS URL for a Google Cloud Bigtable table. For Google Cloud Datastore backups, exactly one URI can be specified. Also, the   wildcard character is not allowed.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.     ..    friendly-name=amet   [Optional] A descriptive name for this table.    id=lorem  [Output-only] An opaque ID uniquely identifying the table.    kind=voluptua.  [Output-only] The type of the resource.    labels=key=rebum.  The labels associated with this table. You can use these to organize and group your tables.

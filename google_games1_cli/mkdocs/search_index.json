You can change the directory used to store configuration with the \n--config-dir\n flag on a per-invocation basis.\n\n\nMore information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nMost APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the \nscope\n determines the \nset of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than \nread-only\n or \nfull-access\n.\n\n\nIf not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a\nmethod that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. \nYou may use the \n--scope\n flag to specify a scope directly. \nAll applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation.\n\n\nThe first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given \nby the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.\n\n\nIf a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as \nJSON\n in the configuration\ndirectory, e.g. \n~/.google-service-cli/games1-token-\nscope-hash\n.json\n. No manual management of these tokens\nis necessary.\n\n\nTo revoke granted authentication, please refer to the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nApplication Secrets\n\n\nIn order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the \n\nGoogle Developer Console\n. APIs the application may use are then enabled for it\none by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota.\n\n\nTo allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI\ncomes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage\nall around the world may deplete the daily quota.\n\n\nYou can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: \n\n~/.google-service-cli/games1-secret.json\n, assuming that the required \ngames\n API \nwas enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the \nGoogle Developer Console\n at \n\nAPIs \n auth -\n Credentials -\n Download JSON\n and used as is.\n\n\nLearn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the \nofficial documentation\n.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nEven though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know\nwhat exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be \noutput to standard error \nas-is\n.\n\n\nThe \n--debug\n flag will print all client-server communication to standard error, whereas the \n--debug-auth\n flag\nwill cause all communication related to authentication to standard error.\nIf the \n--debug\n flag is set, error-results will be debug-printed, possibly yielding more information about the \nissue at hand.\n\n\nYou may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. \ngames1 --debug \nresource\n \nmethod\n [options] 2\ndebug.txt\n.",

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nPushTokenId:\n  ios:\n    apns-device-token: string\n    apns-environment: string\n  kind: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .ios    apns-device-token=et\n\n\nDevice token supplied by an iOS system call to register for remote notifications. Encode this field as web-safe base64.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\napns-environment=dolores\n\n\n\n\nIndicates whether this token should be used for the production or sandbox APNS server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..    kind=kasd\n\n\n\n\nUniquely identifies the type of this resource. Value is always the fixed string games#pushTokenId.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character.

Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n. Each additional \n.\n moves it up one additional level.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.   -r .auto-matching-criteria    exclusive-bitmask=sea  A bitmask indicating when auto-matches are valid. When ANDed with other exclusive bitmasks, the result must be zero. Can be used to support exclusive roles within a game.    kind=nonumy  Uniquely identifies the type of this resource. Value is always the fixed string games#roomAutoMatchingCriteria.    max-auto-matching-players=82  The maximum number of players that should be added to the room by auto-matching.     min-auto-matching-players=40   The minimum number of players that should be added to the room by auto-matching.     ..    capabilities=sadipscing   The capabilities that this client supports for realtime communication.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    client-address    kind=aliquyam  Uniquely identifies the type of this resource. Value is always the fixed string games#roomClientAddress.     xmpp-address=ea   The XMPP address of the client on the Google Games XMPP network.     ..    invited-player-ids=no   The player IDs to invite to the room.  Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.    kind=justo  Uniquely identifies the type of this resource. Value is always the fixed string games#roomCreateRequest.    network-diagnostics    android-network-subtype=80  The Android network subtype.    android-network-type=67  The Android network type.    ios-network-type=84  iOS network type as defined in Reachability.h.    kind=diam  Uniquely identifies the type of this resource. Value is always the fixed string games#networkDiagnostics.    network-operator-code=ipsum  The MCC+MNC code for the client s network connection.

This number is used at the server to ensure that the request is handled correctly across retries.    variant=69  The variant / mode of the application to be played. This can be any integer value, or left blank. You should use a small number of variants to keep the auto-matching pool as large as possible.",

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.\nIn the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.\n\n\nFor example, a structure like this:\n\n\nPlayerScoreSubmissionList:\n  kind: string\n\n\n\n\n\ncan be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n-r .    kind=eirmod\n\n\nUniquely identifies the type of this resource. Value is always the fixed string games#playerScoreSubmissionList.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cursors\n\n\nThe cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:\n\n\n\n\nThe cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the \n.\n character. Fields can be nested such as in \n-r f.s.o\n .\n\n\nThe cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with \n.\n, e.g. \n-r .s.s\n\n\nYou can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify \n-r struct.sub_struct=bar\n.\n\n\nYou can move the cursor one level up by using \n..\n.
